Some Texas geologists believe the best way to get rid of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is to simply put it back where it came from.
Sequestrators say carbon dioxide (CO2) would be captured using  solvents, either before or after the fossil fuel is burned in the  plant.
So-called carbon sequestration is not a new idea.
Less than a decade ago, the idea  of capturing and storing the carbon gases blamed for driving the  Earth towards climate-change peril was usually dismissed with a  laugh.
