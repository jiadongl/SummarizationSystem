Some Texas geologists believe the best way to get rid of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is to simply put it back where it came from.
Sequestrators say carbon dioxide (CO2) would be captured using  solvents, either before or after the fossil fuel is burned in the  plant.
But a more ambitious possibility is "carbon negative," or  removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
