	<Sentences>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">For release Sunday, Oct. 3</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">WASHINGTON -- The death penalty, drugs and civil rights are before the Supreme Court in its new term, which begins Monday with relatively little public notice amid the presidential campaign's final month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">While President Bush and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., pound away at each other on the stump, the nine justices will start their session at 10 a.m. with the court's marshal saying, &quot;God save the United States and this honorable court.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">But the calm of the courtroom is probably what the deliberative justices would prefer this fall, just four years after a presidential election in which they attracted global attention and essentially cast the deciding vote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">&quot;They (the justices) are probably perfectly happy that people are concerned about other things,&quot; said attorney Theodore Olson, who argued Bush's case in the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore that ended the Florida recount, sealing Bush's victory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">The justices, however, would not shy away if this year's election also arrived at their doorstep, added Olson, who served from 2001 until July as U.S. solicitor general, President Bush's top lawyer before the high court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">The justices this year have already shown that they are not afraid to revisit earlier rulings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">In taking the case of a man convicted of murder when he was 17, the court will reconsider its 1989 decision in Stanford v. Kentucky that the Constitution permits the execution of 16-year-old killers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="7">To raise that minimum age, the court would need to decide that a national consensus has emerged since that year that it is cruel and unusual to execute murderers who had not reached adulthood when they committed their crime.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">Attorneys for the man, Christopher Simmons, are urging the Supreme Court to do for youngsters on death row what it did two years ago for condemned killers who have mental retardation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">In 2002, it overturned a 1989 ruling that had permitted executing the mentally retarded, saying that a national consensus had emerged that executing such people violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="8">It based its decision largely on the growing number of death-penalty states to have outlawed such executions: up from two in 1989 to 16 in 2002.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">But Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon says the court should hold fast to its decision allowing the execution of minors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">Some killings are so heinous as to warrant not only charging minors as adults -- as is often the case today -- but to hold them to the ultimate penalty as well, he argues.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">Simmons was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993, when he was 17, for forcing Shirley Crook from her bed, tying her hands and legs together with electric cable, covering her face with duct tape and pushing her from a railroad trestle into a river below, where she drowned.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="10">The Missouri Supreme Court last year upheld the conviction but threw out the death sentence, saying that to execute someone for crimes committed before reaching age 18 would be cruel and unusual in light of current societal standards.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">The justices will hear arguments in the Missouri case, Roper v. Simmons, on Oct. 13 and render their decision by the summer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">(Optional add begins)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">Nixon, pressing Missouri's appeal to the justices, assails that ruling as violating the U.S. Supreme Court's still valid decision from 1989 that executing 17 year olds is permissible.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="13">Though the Missouri court might feel times have changed, it must continue to rely on the justices' determination, he writes in the state's appeal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">The attorney general also disputes that a national consensus has emerged against executing childhood offenders, saying it has become increasingly common during the past decade for violent young offenders to be tried and sentenced as adults.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">Countering the state, Simmons' lawyers argue that the Missouri court merely followed the justices' test for determining whether decency standards have evolved sufficiently to warrant a change in applying the death penalty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="15">Death-penalty states during the past decade have moved to abolish the punishment as applied to minors, and the number of killers under age 18 sentenced to death has dropped from 14 in 1999 to two last year, the lawyers said, citing data from statistician Victor Streib.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">(Optional add ends)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="17">In a case on marijuana, the justices will consider whether Congress overstepped its authority by outlawing marijuana use for medicinal purposes when the plant is grown in the same state where it is prescribed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">The 9th U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="18">Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the federal Controlled Substances Act cannot be enforced against two California residents who were prescribed marijuana to treat debilitating medical conditions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="18">The San Francisco-based court said Congress' constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce cannot be invoked to outlaw the medicinal use of marijuana grown, prescribed and used in the same state.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Appealing that decision to the justices, the government says Congress can outlaw the intrastate use of dangerous drugs even if state law allows doctors to prescribe them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="19">It argues the use of illegal drugs cannot be confined to one state, but rather inevitably spills over into interstate trade, which Congress can regulate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">&quot;Local manufacturing, possession and use of controlled substances increase the demand for such drugs, which in turn leads to increased supply and marketing to users,&quot; the government states in papers filed with the high court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">The California residents counter that using marijuana on a limited, as medically necessary basis has no significant impact on the interstate drug trade.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="21">In addition, Congress tramples on states' rights when it seeks to regulate the use of a drug that state law says may be prescribed for certain medical conditions, Angel Raich and Diane Monson state in papers filed with the justices.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="22">Raich suffers from a variety of chronically painful medical conditions, including scoliosis, joint dysfunction, headaches, multiple chemical sensitivities, asthma and seizures.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="22">Monson suffers from a degenerative spinal disease that causes chronic back pain and painful muscle spasms.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="22">They each have been prescribed marijuana to relieve the pain, which is permitted under California's 1996 Compassionate Use Act.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="23">Eight other states have enacted similar &quot;medical marijuana&quot; laws, including Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="24">The case is Ashcroft v. Raich.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="25">In a coaching case testing civil rights, Roderick Jackson claims the Birmingham, Ala., Board of Education fired him in 2001 as a high-school girls basketball coach after he protested to supervisors that his team was not receiving the same funding and access to athletic facilities as the boys' squad.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="25">Jackson sued the board, claiming that his retaliatory firing violated Title IX of the federal 1972 Education Amendments, which requires equal treatment of boys and girls teams in scholastic sports.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="26">The U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama dismissed Jackson's lawsuit, saying Title IX has no provision allowing people to sue for retaliatory actions by school officials.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="26">The Atlanta-based 11th U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="26">Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="27">In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Jackson argues that the right to sue for retaliation is implicit in any anti-discrimination law.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="27">Accordingly, the U.S. Education Department has adopted regulations that protect teachers who complain about illegal bias, Jackson states in papers filed with the justices.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="28">&quot;If schools and other defendants could freely retaliate against those who protest discriminatory treatment, they would effectively be engaging in the discrimination prohibited by the statute,&quot; Jackson wrote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="29">The U.S. government supports Jackson's position in a legal brief filed with the court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="30">&quot;Just as Title IX's broad prohibition against intentional discrimination covers other forms of intentional discrimination to which the statute does not specifically refer (e.g.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="30">sexual harassment), it covers intentionally discriminatory retaliation,&quot; the government states.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="30">&quot;Teachers and coaches are often in a much better position to identify sex discrimination and express opposition to it than are the students who are denied equal educational opportunities.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="31">The school board counters that courts should not read into Title IX a right to sue that is not explicitly stated in the statute.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="32">The case is Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="33">The court is expected to render by the summer its decisions in the approximately 80 cases it will hear between October and April.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="33">The coming term marks the 11th consecutive one with the same nine justices, further extending this panel's modern record for Supreme Court stability.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Three months ago, the Supreme Court issued an opinion that seemed to outlaw the way much of the nation sentences criminals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="1">Then they went on vacation, leaving judges, prosecutors, and thousands of defendants confused about what to do.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="1">As the justices return to work Monday, their first task is to belatedly explain the new rules.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">The new term is dominated by criminal justice matters, with cases involving the death penalty for juveniles, medical marijuana, drug-sniffing police dogs during routine traffic stops, and the continued detention of Cubans brought over during the Mariel boat-lift who finished their prison sentences but cannot be returned to Cuba because Fidel Castro will not take them back.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">But before the court can take on the new issues, it will revisit its 5-to-4 decision last term in Blakeley v. Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">In that case, it struck down guidelines under which judges add time to the normal range for a sentence based on aggravating facts not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury - for example, increasing the penalty for a kidnapping conviction if the offense involved cruel mistreatment of a victim.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">The majority said such a system violates the Constitution's guarantee of a jury trial.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">Because as many as 21 states and the federal government use a similar arrangement, the ruling cast much of the criminal justice system into doubt and had an immediate impact on thousands of open cases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">But the justices neglected to explain the implications of their decision, and lower courts have come up with wildly different interpretations of what it meant.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">&quot;They went off for three months on vacation, leaving a lot of people scrambling to figure out how to make the system work,&quot; said Julie O'Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">&quot;That struck me as an irresponsible and arrogant thing to do.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="6">They have to decide just how much remains of the federal sentencing system.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">Seeking an opinion that will clear up the confusion, the federal government asked for expedited review of the cases of Duncan Fanfan and Freddie J. Booker, both convicts challenging their guideline-set sentences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">At risk is the whole system of judges examining the facts after a basic jury verdict to come up with sentences that distinguish between bad and worse instances of a crime.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="7">If the court strikes down guidelines, many current defendants could receive only a minimum sentence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="7">But that defense victory could prove Pyrrhic: Analysts say legislatures could respond by imposing harsher mandatory sentences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">The arguments Monday will kick off a near-record 10th term for the court without a lineup change.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">Few expect the aging panel to remain intact another four years, so the upcoming presidential election's most long-lasting impact may be in deciding who gets to nominate multiple replacements, thus transforming its current balance into a controlling ideological majority.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">In the meantime, the justices have filled half the term's calendar and continue to review other appeals; one closely watched potential case is a challenge to Florida's ban on gay adoptions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="9">Rulings will be issued by the end of the term in June.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">No terrorism case is on the calendar following the court's historic decision in that arena last term, when it sharply curtailed President Bush's claimed wartime power to indefinitely imprison suspected terrorists beyond the reach of judicial review.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="10">But there are several cases dealing with the detention and deportation of noncitizens.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">In Clark v. Martinez and Benitez v. Bozos, for example, the court will decide whether the government can continue to indefinitely imprison Cuban criminals from the 1980 Mariel boat-lift who were never granted legal entry into the United States, but were &quot;paroled&quot; into the country.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">Having committed crimes and served out their sentences, they face deportation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="12">But Cuba refuses to accept them, so they and about 900 others are locked up in limbo.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="12">In 2001, the court ruled that detaining legal immigrants for more than six months was unconstitutional.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="12">This case will decide whether people who have not legally entered the country have the same rights.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">One case of local interest is Smith v. Massachusetts, which comes from a 1996 shooting in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="13">The court must decide whether defendant Melvin Smith's &quot;double jeopardy&quot; protection against successive prosecution was violated when a judge first granted a defense motion to declare him not guilty of a charge, then withdrew that verdict and allowed the charge to go to a jury.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">A Connecticut case, Kelo v. New London, will determine whether a government can use eminent domain to clear space for private redevelopment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="14">The Fifth Amendment limits the power to force unwilling owners to sell in cases where the property will be put to &quot;public use,&quot; usually for something like a road.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="14">Here, a neighborhood would be razed for the &quot;public purpose&quot; of generating greater tax revenue.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">Roper v. Simmons presents the court with an opportunity to strike down the death penalty for crimes committed by a juvenile.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="15">The case arrives two years after its decision to strike down the death penalty for mentally retarded criminals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">The court had upheld both policies in 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="16">In reversing course for criminals with diminished mental abilities, it reasoned that society's evolving standard of decency had reached a consensus that such criminals were less culpable than people of normal intelligence and so executing them</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">is considered &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">Challengers to the juvenile death penalty similarly argue that the number of death sentences for offenses committed by minors has dwindled and there is a growing reluctance to carry out such executions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">Because nearly the entire world has outlawed the juvenile death penalty, court watchers are interested in whether justices will cite foreign practices, as some did when striking down sodomy laws two years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="19">The emerging trend of looking abroad for comparative input has drawn fire from conservatives, who say only domestic law should be relevant.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">In Illinois v. Caballes, the court will decide whether police may search a car with a drug-sniffing dog during a routine traffic stop without an individualized reason to be suspicious.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="20">The case hinges on what expectation of privacy people driving in their car have.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">In Ashcroft v. Reich, the court will consider whether federal agents lack authority to interfere with medical marijuana grown by seriously ill people who do not take it across state lines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="21">California voters legalized medicinal marijuana in state law eight years ago, but it remains illegal under federal law.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="22">The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a generally liberal court based in San Francisco, ruled that home-grown and home-consumed marijuana is not related to interstate commerce, and so the Constitution does not give Congress the authority to regulate it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="23">That invokes the same reasoning that conservative majorities on the Supreme Court have used to strike down federal laws against guns in schools and violence against women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="23">But the Supreme Court frequently reverses the Ninth Circuit and has consistently rejected challenges to federal drug laws.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="24">&quot;This represents another case in an ongoing battle between the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit is playing games,&quot; said Michael Gottesman, a law professor at Georgetown.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="24">&quot;If you play games and the other side is the Supreme Court, you're not going to win.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">A possible revolution in the federal criminal justice system will be on the agenda when the Supreme Court opens its new term Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">In a rare two-hour afternoon oral argument session, the justices will consider whether the federal sentencing guidelines -- a manual of 400-plus pages meant to ensure that federal courts give defendants across the country approximately equal punishments for similar crimes -- can be reconciled with the Constitution.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">The court is hearing the case on an expedited schedule in response to the uproar and confusion created by a 5 to 4 ruling it issued June 24, just before leaving for summer recess.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">In that case, Blakely vs. Washington, the court struck down Washington state's sentencing guidelines, which, like the federal guidelines, permit judges to boost sentences based on their own post-conviction fact-finding, rather than relying only on facts admitted by the defendant or found by a jury.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">That, the court ruled, violates the right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">Though the court said in Blakely that it did not address the federal guidelines, the similarities between Washington's system and the federal system were such that defense lawyers across the country immediately began bombarding courts with Blakely challenges to their clients' sentences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">Lower courts have issued differing rulings in response, and some federal prosecutors have felt obliged to redraft indictments to make sure they conform to Blakely.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">``It looks like a Number 10 earthquake to me,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who dissented in Blakely, told a conference of federal judges in July.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">Although determining the precise magnitude of the Blakely aftershocks is the court's first major item of business, Blakely is by no means the only case of potential national significance on the court's docket.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">On Oct. 13, the court will hear arguments in Roper vs. Simmons, No.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="10">03-633, a challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty for persons who commit crimes while younger than 18.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">The court has barred capital punishment for those younger than 16, but it ruled in 1989 that capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-old defendants does not constitute ``cruel and unusual punishment.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">However, the court may decide that a ``national consensus'' has now formed against imposing the ultimate penalty against minors -- just as it did in 2002 with respect to the death penalty for moderately mentally retarded offenders.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="13">It is nearly certain that the court's two swing voters, Justices O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, will determine the outcome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="13">Four members of the court -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already declared in a published opinion that they believe the death penalty for juveniles should be abolished.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="14">Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas opposed the 2002 mental retardation ruling, which opponents of capital punishment for juveniles are relying on to make their case.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="14">(Optional Add End)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="15">If the court throws out the sentencing guidelines, the issue will return to Congress.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="15">Early congressional reactions to Blakely suggest that the ultimate result of scrapping the guidelines would be harsher penalties prescribed by politicians reluctant to be seen as soft on crime.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="16">''(I)t may take only a couple of lenient sentences in high-profile cases to raise enough of a stir to increase mandatory minimum penalties,'' Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said at a July 13 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">The Supreme Court justices, a solemn and sober lot, will spend time this fall talking about wine, beef, marijuana and dogs, all part of their wide-ranging duty to police the limits of the government's power.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">They will also consider whether young murderers can be put to death for their crimes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">But when the court's term officially opens Monday, the first order of business will be to answer a question raised at the end of the last term: Is the federal sentencing system, which punishes 64,000 criminals a year, unconstitutional because it allows judges, acting alone, to add to prison terms?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">If so, the Supreme Court may force a profound shift in how criminals are sentenced in America, one that will affect the state courts in many states as well as the federal system.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">Until now, the general understanding has been that prosecutors charge defendants with a crime, juries typically decide whether they are guilty and, if so, judges impose the punishment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">In recent rulings, however, a narrow Supreme Court majority has said the right to a jury trial also includes the right to have a jury decide the key facts that determine a sentence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">Other than a prior conviction, ``any fact that increases the penalty for a crime'' must be decided by the jury or admitted by the defendant, Justice Antonin Scalia said for a 5-4 majority in the case of Blakeley vs. Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">That simple statement struck down the sentencing system in Washington state, and it now threatens to do the same in the federal system.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">In both, judges are authorized to decide the ``aggravating factors'' that increase a prison term.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">Take, for example, the case of Ducan Fanfan, who last year sold a small bag of cocaine to an informer outside a Burger King restaurant near Portland, Maine.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="8">A jury found him guilty as charged of selling at least 500 grams of cocaine, a crime that called for six years in prison under U.S. sentencing guidelines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">On June 28, four days after the Blakely ruling, Fanfan came before a federal judge for sentencing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="9">Prosecutors said the defendant was the leader of a drug gang who had 2.5 kilograms of cocaine in his home and car.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="9">Based on these facts -- which the judge found to be true -- Fanfan should go to prison for 16 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">However, imposing such a stiff sentence would be unconstitutional under the just-announced Blakely ruling, the judge concluded.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="10">So he sent Fanfan to prison for six years based on just the jury's verdict.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">Bush administration lawyers appealed Fanfan's case directly to the Supreme Court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="11">They argued that it made a ``mockery'' of the law by permitting judges to give more lenient sentences based on certain facts but forbidding them from increasing the sentences based on other facts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">Fanfan's is one of two cases that will be heard Monday afternoon as the justices debate what to do with the federal sentencing system.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">The outcome is likely to affect most state courts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">The future of the death penalty for young murderers also is in doubt.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="14">Four liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already said they view such as executions as ``shameful'' and a ``relic of the past.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="14">If they are joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor or Anthony M. Kennedy, the court would limit capital punishment to those who are age 18 or older at the time of their crime.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">Since 1990, only Texas, Oklahoma and Virginia have carried out executions of young murderers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="15">The justices will take up a Missouri case, Roper vs. Simmons, on Oct. 13 to decide the issue.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">A plea to declare capital punishment for juvenile offenders unconstitutional received a skeptical hearing at the Supreme Court Wednesday, as one of two justices likely to be pivotal to the outcome voiced repeated doubts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">Justice Anthony Kennedy observed that he was ``troubled'' that a ban might lead gang leaders to use 16- or 17-year-olds as ``hit men.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">``I'm very concerned about that,'' Kennedy told Seth Waxman, a former solicitor general of the United States who was arguing on behalf of Missouri death row inmate Christopher Simmons, who faces execution for a murder he committed at 17.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="3">``I'm talking about the deterrent value of the existing rule.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">Waxman replied that deterrence does not work with juvenile offenders because they ``are impulsive and subject to peer pressure.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="5">But Kennedy responded that many 17-year-old offenders were ``ringleaders'' in brutal, calculated murders, according to a friend-of-the-court brief filed by a group of states that wish to retain a death penalty for juveniles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="5">Kennedy said the brief was ``chilling reading.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="6">Kennedy's vote is crucial because four justices, John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, have already declared their belief that executing those who commit crimes while under the age of 18 is ``cruel and unusual punishment.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="7">The records of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas suggest that they think the issue should be left up to the states.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="8">That leaves only Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as possible fifth votes for a ban.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="8">O'Connor was mostly silent in Wednesday's hearing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="9">The Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-old offenders in 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="9">It banned it for those 15 and under in 1988.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">Until now, the court's position has been unaffected by its 2002 decision to ban the death penalty for the moderately mentally retarded.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="10">In that case, Kennedy and O'Connor joined Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">The court found that a national consensus against the practice had formed since 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="11">The best evidence for that, the court ruled, was that the number of states banning the death penalty for the retarded had grown from two to 13.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="12">Many death penalty opponents immediately recognized that a similar argument could be applied to juveniles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="13">Yet in the 2002 opinion, written by Stevens, the court seemed to warn that it was not ready for that, contrasting the strong trend against executing the retarded with the fact that, between 1989 and 2002, only two states had raised their death penalty ages to 18.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="14">Three times in the last two years, the court refused to hear appeals from death-row inmates who had killed while juveniles -- despite a strongly worded dissent in one case from Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="15">Last year, the court actually reinstated the death penalty of a juvenile offender in Oklahoma after a federal appeals court had blocked it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="15">The vote was 5 to 4, with both Kennedy and O'Connor in the majority.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="16">The court intervened in the Simmons case only after the Missouri Supreme Court threw out Simmons' sentence last year on the grounds that the 1989 precedent had, indeed, been superseded by the 2002 case.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="17">Waxman pressed a similar argument Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="17">He told the court that the execution of juvenile criminals conflicts with a ``robust consensus'' reflected in the recent decisions of several states to ban the practice and in the decreasing frequency with which juries actually impose the death penalty on those under 18.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="17">Scientific evidence shows that areas of the brain in charge of judgment and impulse control are incomplete in adolescents, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="18">Death is the wrong punishment for crimes that reflect ``the transient psychosocial characteristics that rage in adolescents,'' Waxman said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="19">But Kennedy noted that the American Psychological Association -- which told the court in a brief in this case that adolescents were too immature to qualify for capital punishment -- had also said in a case about parental notification for abortion that teen-agers were old enough to make such a decision on their own.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="20">``They flip-flopped,'' Kennedy said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="21">Waxman said there was no inconsistency, because ``what was at issue in that case was the competency to decide,'' while the question in this case is ``factors why adolescents are less morally culpable.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="22">He also urged the court to act based on a ``worldwide consensus'' against the death penalty for juveniles, noting that except for the United States, all 110 countries that retain capital punishment do not apply it to those under 18.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="23">States that permit it ``are not just alone in this country, they are alone in the world,'' he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="24">On this point, Kennedy appeared to sympathize with Waxman, asking Missouri state solicitor James Layton, ``There seems to be a very substantial demonstration that world opinion is against us.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="24">...</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="24">Does that have a bearing on what's `unusual''' punishment?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="25">Layton replied that ``what matters'' is American legislation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="26">O'Connor's only remark also hinted at some openness to Waxman's position.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="27">Addressing Layton, she noted that the number of states that either do not have capital punishment or set the age at 18 is ``about the same'' as the number of those that banned executing the retarded in 2002, which was 30.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="28">``There is no inexorable trend here,'' Layton replied.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="29">The case is Roper vs. Simmons.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="29">A decision is expected by July.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday over whether the time has come to end the death penalty for young murderers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="1">Now that Iran and Congo say they have repudiated the practice, the United States stands alone in the world in sanctioning the execution of minors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">Two years ago, the court in a 6-3 decision abolished capital punishment for the mentally retarded, saying that a ``national consensus'' had emerged that executing such persons amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="2">They noted that all but a handful of states had exempted mentally retarded persons from the death penalty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">On Wednesday, the justices debated whether a similar national consensus exists that now calls for limiting capital punishment to murderers who are age 18 or above when they commit crimes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="4">Despite the vote of two years ago, it was not clear from Wednesday's argument that a majority would exempt youthful killers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he was worried that teenage criminals will be emboldened if they are free from the full force of the criminal law.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="5">``Juveniles run in gangs,'' he said, reasoning that gang members would dodge the death penalty by recruiting their youngest members as ``the hit man.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">``I'm very concerned about that,'' said Kennedy, who voted in the majority to stop the death penalty for mentally retarded individuals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the other swing vote, noted that several states in recent years have raised the minimum age to 18 for imposing the death penalty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="7">``It's about the same consensus that existed on mental retardation,'' she said, in a hopeful sign for the foes of capital punishment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="8">Currently, most states either have no death penalty law or set 18 as the minimum age.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="8">Still, 19 states permit prosecutors to seek a death sentence for murderers who are 16 or 17, although fewer have done so of late.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="8">In 1999, for example, 14 underage murderers received death sentences, but the number has declined steadily.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="8">Only two teenage murderers received death sentences last year and only one such sentence has been handed down this year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="9">The clear leader remains Texas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="9">As of June 30, 72 people who were 16 or 17 at the time of their crimes sat on death rows around the nation, and 28 of them were in Texas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="10">The case before the court Wednesday came from Missouri.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="10">It concerned Christopher Simmons, who in 1993 abducted a woman in his neighborhood, bound her in duct tape and threw her alive into a river from a railroad bridge.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="10">He was 17 at the time of the murder and bragged to a friend that he would get off because of his age.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="11">Instead, a jury outside St. Louis convicted him and sentenced him to die.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="11">The Missouri Supreme Court voided the death sentence and ordered him to spend life in prison, and the state attorney general filed an appeal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="12">James Layton, a Missouri state attorney, urged the justices to let juries weigh each case and decide for themselves when a murderer deserves death.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="13">If the age for capital punishment needs to be changed, it should be done by elected lawmakers, not judges, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="13">``Age is a legislative question.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="13">It is the kind of fact a legislature should decide, not this court,'' he argued.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="14">Seth Waxman, the former U.S. solicitor general in the Clinton administration, argued for Simmons and he urged the high court to set a constitutional rule that limits capital punishment to those who are legally adults.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="15">In law, ``18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood,'' he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="15">Since young people need to be age 18 to vote, to join the military, to gamble, or even to marry without their parents' consent, it is reasonable to set 18 as the minimum age for capital punishment, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="16">``We are literally alone in the world'' in permitting the executions of those who committed crimes as juveniles, Waxman said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="17">The United Nations Commission on Human Rights said six nations besides the United States executed juvenile offenders during the 1990s.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="17">They are Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="17">But its report said all of these countries have repudiated the practice in the past five years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="18">A long list of other groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the European Union and Nobel Prize laureates led by former President Carter, filed briefs urging the court to halt the execution of young offenders.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="19">Four justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have said in the past they believe such executions are a ``shameful practice'' and should be abolished.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="1">The Supreme Court on Wednesday struggled to assess the morality and propriety of states' executing murderers who killed at age 16 or 17 _ the ultimate punishment carried out in few places outside the United States.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="2">Still, 19 of 50 states allow the death penalty for those older teenage killers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="3">Justices debated whether such killers are children who cannot grasp the consequences of their actions and should be kept from death row, or criminals whose executions would ensure justice for victims and deter other youths.</sentence>
