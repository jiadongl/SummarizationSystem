Major League Baseball owners Friday conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington for the upcoming season.
The city's top two political leaders cleared the way Monday night for Major League Baseball in the nation's capital, after daylong negotiations to guarantee the construction of a stadium that baseball officials demanded to relocate the former Montreal Expos here.
The White House said Thursday it hoped that the city of Washington and Major League Baseball could still reach an agreement that would bring a professional team to the US capital city.
