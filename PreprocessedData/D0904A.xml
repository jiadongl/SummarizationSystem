		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">For Joan Humphrey Lefkow, the nightmare began shortly after her 2000 appointment as a federal judge, when an Oregon group's lawsuit to block white supremacists from using a name it had trademarked, World Church of the Creator, landed in her lap.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Soon, Lefkow found her home address and family photographs posted along with violent threats on hate-filled Websites, and last April, one of the Aryan movement's most notorious leaders was convicted of plotting her murder.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">On Tuesday, Lefkow sat sequestered under armed federal guard in an undisclosed location, mourning her husband of 30 years and her 89-year-old mother, whom she found dead of gunshots to the head in their basement the day before, sending her screaming into the quiet street.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">&quot;I think she's very upset with herself, maybe, for being a judge and putting her family in this danger,&quot; said Laura Lefkow, 20, the third of the judge's five daughters, &quot;but there's no way she should have known.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">Local and federal law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that they were investigating possible connections between the double murder and Matthew Hale, the white supremacist currently in federal prison for soliciting Lefkow's assassination, or his many sympathizers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">Federal officials in Washington said agents were scrubbing Lefkow's entire caseload in search of suspects, with the main thrust on the hate groups that had targeted her before.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">Already, some white supremacists were celebrating the killings on the Internet, while others spun conspiracy theories that the crime was committed by Hale's enemies to poison the atmosphere before his sentencing next month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="6">Experts who have spent years tracking Hale's organization -- now called Creativity -- also pointed to the upcoming sentencing, noting that one of his acolytes, Benjamin Smith, went on a shooting spree in 1999 after Hale was rejected by the Illinois bar.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">&quot;We saw what happened the last time Matt Hale got slapped in the face by the system: The price of that was two dead and nine severely wounded,&quot; said Mark Potok, director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="7">&quot;Now Matt Hale is about to be sentenced, very probably, to most of his natural life to federal prison.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="7">It's very possible that a Hale follower or sympathizer has decided to fight back.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">(STORY CAN END HERE.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">Billy Roper, a friend of Hale's who is chairman of a group called White Revolution, disavowed the violence but offered a different parallel: the FBI's 1992 confrontation in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, with the white separatist Randall C. Weaver, whose wife and 14-year-old son wound up dead.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">&quot;We can stand alongside the federal law enforcement community in saying just as they felt a deep regret and sadness over the death of Randy Weaver's family so we also feel a deep sense of regret and sadness over the death of Judge Lefkow's family,&quot; Roper said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="10">&quot;If it was the case that someone was misguided and thought that they were helping Matt Hale, then it would be similar in that other people had suffered for one person's mistake.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">Hale, who is representing himself, faces up to 40 years in prison, and has been held for two years in the Metropolitan Correctional Center here under special administrative measures, reserved for terrorists, that limited contact with the outside world.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">Federal officials refused to discuss the restrictions, but his mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, said that she and his father are the only people he is allowed contact with, and that they are limited to 15-minute phone calls each Thursday morning, and separate hourlong visits twice a month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">&quot;He had nothing to do with what went on last night,&quot; Hutcheson said in a telephone interview from her home in East Peoria, Ill. &quot;My son is sitting in a hole where he's not allowed to even speak loud enough to be audible.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">&quot;Common sense would tell you, if he were into having somebody kill somebody -- which he is not -- would he have somebody go kill the judge's family just before he's sentenced?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="14">she added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="14">&quot;Somebody has done this to make him get an enhanced sentence.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">The authorities cautioned that it is too soon to focus on any one theory of the crime, though they did not offer other possible scenarios or motives.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="15">Casings from .22-caliber bullets were found at the scene, and the medical examiner cited the cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">James Molloy, the Chicago Police Department's chief of detectives, said the murders happened between 10:30 a.m., when Lefkow's mother answered a telephone call from one of her granddaughters, and 5:30 p.m. when the judge returned home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="16">At 4 p.m., the Lefkows' youngest daughter, Margaret, 16, came home to get her gym bag and left without seeing anyone in the house, Molloy said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="17">&quot;There is much speculation about possible links between this crime and the possible involvement of hate groups,&quot; he said at a news conference.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="17">&quot;This is but one facet of our investigation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="17">We are looking in many, many directions.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">Hiram Grau, the department's deputy superintendent, said: &quot;The questions you have are the same ones we have and we are working around the clock to get them answered.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Shannon Metzger, a spokesman for the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="19">Marshal's service, said that Lefkow had a special protective detail for &quot;a couple of weeks&quot; last year, but it was disbanded when the threats against her were deemed &quot;not viable.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="19">Molloy said the Chicago police also had stopped its practice of sending cars to her home for additional patrols, and Lefkow, her daughter, said the authorities had long ago removed the security cameras it had installed in their home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">&quot;I guess because the FBI felt it seemed like there was no danger,&quot; said Laura Lefkow, a sophomore at Pomona College in Southern California.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">But on Monday night, federal marshals met Laura Lefkow's plane from Los Angeles, and they stood guard on Tuesday as the family planned Saturday funerals for Michael F. Lefkow, 64, an attorney who was a leader in the Episcopal church, and Donna Humphrey, 89, an ailing grandmother who hand-stitched quilts for each of her 23 descendants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="22">Michael Lefkow, who ran unsuccessfully for Cook County judge in 2002 and 2004, argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and worked for the Legal Aid Society and the U.S.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="22">Postal Service before starting a solo firm about 20 years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="22">He spent every Sunday at St. Luke's in Evanston, flirting with the elderly women in the pews, and since 1992 had been a lay member of the governing committee of the Chicago Diocese of the Episcopal Church.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="23">A flamenco dancer and tennis player, Lefkow met his future wife in the library of Wheaton College, where she was an undergraduate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="23">&quot;She was doing a paper on Indonesia and he was doing a paper on Indonesia, and she had all his books,&quot; Laura Lefkow recalled of her parents' first encounter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="23">&quot;Then he asked her out for a beer, and she said maybe coffee.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="24">Lefkow said that her father, a former cab driver, bus driver and substitute teacher, sought out the local courthouse, post office and Episcopal church wherever he went, because he saw them as the &quot;pillars of society.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="25">&quot;He used to say he was rich in daughters and not much else,&quot; she laughed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="25">&quot;He was just an optimist about everything, to the point where it was like, 'Oh my gosh, dad, come on,' and he would be like, 'It'll be fine,' and it was.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="25">It was always fine.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="26">Laura's grandmother, Humphrey, who lived in a tan townhouse in Denver, had been staying with the judge's family since before Christmas as she recovered from a kidney infection.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="26">Neighbors in Denver said she played Solitaire and Scrabble on a computer and frequently cooked big meals for friends.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="27">Joan Lefkow, a magistrate judge since 1982, was appointed to the U.S. District Court by President Clinton, and originally ruled in favor of Hale, dismissing the trademark case, in 2002.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="27">But after an appeals court reversed her decision, Lefkow had little choice but to order Hale to remove the World Church name from his Web sites and printed material or face fines of $1,000 per day.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="28">She was immediately vilified -- Hal Turner, an underground radio personality, said on his show that she was &quot;worthy of being killed,&quot; adding that &quot;it wouldn't be legal but in my opinion it wouldn't be wrong.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="28">Hale, who called himself Pontifex Maximus of the church that at one point claimed 30,000 members, was arrested in January 2003, after an FBI informant infiltrated the church to become his security chief.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="29">The informant, Anthony Evola, provided an e-mail message in which Hale sought Lefkow's home address, and a tape recording of them discussing her fate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="29">&quot;We gonna exterminate the rat?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="29">Evola asked.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="29">Hale said that he prefers to &quot;fight within the law&quot; but &quot;if you wish to, ah, do anything yourself, you can, you know?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="29">When Evola said, &quot;Consider it done,&quot; Hale responded, &quot;Good.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="30">Beth Sycamore, a publishing consultant who lives three houses away, said the Lefkows strolled the neighborhood, holding hands, and took the el train even amid the death threats.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="30">&quot;She wasn't afraid,&quot; Sycamore said of the judge.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="30">&quot;They just didn't want it to affect their lives.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="31">Potok, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Hale's organization splintered and foundered upon his arrest, shrinking from a high in the 1990s of 88 chapters to just five in 2003, but jumped to at least 16 chapters last year and remains one of the nation's most violent groups.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="31">Sympathizers abound.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="32">&quot;Everyone associated with the Matt Hale trial has deserved assassination for a long time,&quot; reads an Internet essay posted on Tuesday by Bill White, editor of the Libertarian Socialist News.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">The officers, many in riot gear, formed a barricade between the protesters and about 100 people who angrily shouted at them to leave Boston.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">Gov.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">Mitt Romney, who attended the Faneuil Hall event, said he was disgusted by the presence of the supremacists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">&quot;Today of all days, to have white supremacists come here from Arkansas, is most disappointing,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">&quot;I wish they'd go back home where the came from and bury themselves under the rocks that they crawled out from.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">In a small industrial park west of Keller, Texas, near sprawling neighborhoods and new schools, a storage facility routinely receives shipments of merchandise geared toward a certain clientele -- white supremacists and anti-Semites.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">An FBI joint task force knows about the place and the people who operate it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">So do the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department and a national watchdog group that monitors hate groups nationwide.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">Aryan Wear, an online clothing, music and book outlet that opposes Jews and promotes white supremacy, keeps much of its merchandise in the storage stall near Fort Worth.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">Incorporated by Fort Worth man, Aryan Wear is one of 10 hate and racially intolerant operations in Dallas-Fort Worth, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is based in Montgomery, Ala., and tracks extremist groups.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">While most such groups' members are open about their views, the operators of Aryan Wear remain for the most part anonymous, letting their online sales pitches spread their message.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">&quot;You don't really have my permission to use my name in your article pertaining to this.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="7">I think this pretty much seals the deal,&quot; said a phone message left at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram by Tony Eynon, who is named as Aryan Wear's president and lone director in corporate records filed with the Texas secretary of state's office in Austin.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">A pilot who was until recently licensed to fly Boeing 737s commercially, Eynon, 30, declined to be interviewed, saying in his phone message that he had recently sold Aryan Wear and that &quot;there's just the finalization of paperwork right now.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">He lives with his wife and young child in a well-established neighborhood -- down the street from a black family and a Hispanic family -- in a home no different from any other on the block until, neighbors say, the garage door rises, revealing a large Confederate flag on the wall.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">Joe Roy, chief researcher for the law center's magazine, the Intelligence Report, called Aryan Wear a &quot;hate-for-profit&quot; business, a kind of one-stop shopping for the fashion needs of white supremacists.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">The Web site's merchandise includes a T-shirt that declares, &quot;Deport Pedro,&quot; another with a picture of Adolf Hitler and the inscription &quot;I was right,&quot; and a third with a design similar to a Tide detergent logo but altered to say, &quot;Pride ... For a Whiter, Brighter Future!&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">Aryan Wear's signature product, however, is a high-laced boot with swastikas carved in the sole, allowing its wearer to leave an impression of the Nazi symbol on soft ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="13">&quot;An outstanding product real skinheads can be proud to be associated with,&quot; one wearer said in a review on the Aryan Wear Web site.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="13">The reviewed called the boots &quot;Too White ...!&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="14">Roy said the boots were created by Eynon's friend Christopher Evans, who was connected with the violence-prone Confederate Hammerskins in Dallas and now lives in the Fort Worth area.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="15">Evans could not be reached for comment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="16">Initially, Roy said, the boots were sold to make money for the National Alliance.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="16">But the once-powerful neo-Nazi organization is now in turmoil, with declining membership, since the death of its longtime leader, William Pierce, in 2002.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="17">Roy said the boots were the alliance's biggest moneymaker until August 2003 when Eynon formed Aryan Wear as a Texas company and began selling the boots exclusively.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="18">A man identifying himself as Jim Reid, who lives near Austin, said in a recent telephone interview that Eynon is no longer associated with Aryan Wear and that he is the new president and chief executive officer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="19">There are three &quot;primary&quot; owners, in Houston, Florida and New Jersey, and the new owners want to remain &quot;silent partners,&quot; Reid said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="20">He denied that the business promotes hatred or that its products -- including the &quot;Happy Hitler Baby Doll&quot; T-shirt -- are overly radical.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="21">&quot;It doesn't have anything to do with hate,&quot; Reid said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="21">&quot;We want to basically present a positive image to the youth and the public in general.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="22">Local officials are not impressed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="23">&quot;I'm glad that authorities are aware of this operation and are keeping an eye on it,&quot; said Roy Brooks, a leader in the local African-American community and a member of the Tarrant County Commissioners Court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="24">&quot;We can't legislate good taste or human compassion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="24">I wish we could,&quot; Brooks said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="25">Lori Bailey, a spokeswoman for the FBI in North Texas, said federal authorities are &quot;keenly aware&quot; of Aryan Wear because of its apparent association with the sometimes violent skinhead movement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="25">Bailey said, however, that the FBI can do little because the business is not breaking the law.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="26">Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson agreed that he saw nothing illegal in Aryan Wear's business tactics.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="26">Still, Anderson said, &quot;they are clearly tied to the white supremacist movement, if you look at the types of merchandise they're offering.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="26">...</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="27">&quot;I think anytime anybody deals in that type of activity, it's a concern for law enforcement,&quot; Anderson said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="27">&quot;It certainly bears watching.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">A city council candidate dropped out of the race Friday after it was disclosed that he posted comments to a white supremacist Internet bulletin board more than 4,000 times.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Doug Hanks said the postings were fictional and designed to win white supremacists' trust as he researched a novel he was writing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="2">He said the book was also meant to appeal to white supremacists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">&quot;I needed information for the book and some other writings I was doing,&quot; Hanks told The Associated Press on Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="3">&quot;I did what I thought I needed to do to establish myself as a credible white nationalist.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">Hanks had filed papers seeking the Republican nomination for one of four at-large council seats, but formally withdrew Friday, said county elections director Michael Dickerson.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">Hanks' postings over the past three years were first reported by The Rhinoceros Times, a weekly newspaper.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">In one June 1 posting, he said blacks should be treated like &quot;rabid beasts.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">Hanks said his self-published novel, called &quot;Patriot Act,&quot; takes themes from &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; _ the racist novel believed to have inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">&quot;I saw how successful these 'Turner Diaries' had been and that was the path to take,&quot; he told the AP.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">White supremacists, he said, &quot;have more of a tendency to word of mouth, to say, 'Hey, you ought to pick this up.'&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">Republican Mayor Pat McCrory condemned Hanks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">&quot;He's a man of total inner hatred in both his heart and soul, and it doesn't matter what party he's in,&quot; McCrory said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">While the promise of this weekend's mass demonstrations have a few jittery, area law enforcement and activists are planning to defuse confrontations that could turn a verbal showdown into a physical brawl.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">Hundreds of peace and pro-Bush demonstrators are expected to pack Crawford and the areas near President Bush's ranch house over the weekend.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="2">However, the potential appearance of white supremacists and the planned Sunday visit of activist and former presidential candidate Rev.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="2">Al Sharpton should help foster the media circus that has been growing on the Texas prairie near the Western White House.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">&quot;Riots, like grass fire, start from the smallest little spark,&quot; said Bill Johnson, who owns the Yellow Rose, a prominent gift shop at Crawford's main intersection.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="3">&quot;We need to prevent that spark.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">Johnson, who is organizing pro-Bush rallies for Saturday, is among the event organizers who realize the perfect storm-in-the-making.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="4">High temperatures, ratcheted rhetoric and crowds of people are sure to fuel tempers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">While there are no official crowd estimates, representatives for both camps believe hundreds will mass in Crawford in support of the president or Cindy Sheehan, the peace mom at the center of demonstrations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">Sheehan has vowed to keep vigil near the president's vacation home until he agrees to meet with her to discuss bringing an end to the Iraq war.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="8">Chief Deputy Randy Plemons said they don't plan to change their standard game plan, which has mostly worked.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">Sheriff's deputies have depended on some level of self-policing by holding individual leaders responsible for groups of people.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="9">Those leaders, in turn, keep others in check by keeping the anti-war and pro-Bush sides separated and discouraging verbal sparring.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="9">When that's not enough, lines of squad cars line up end-to-end to physically block opposing demonstrators from one another.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="12">On the Internet, a forum posting from the Stormfront White Nationalist Community urged white supremacists to come to Crawford this weekend to speak out against the war.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="12">The posting claims that the Iraq war bolsters Israel.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="13">A Sheehan spokesman said the white supremacists were not invited by anyone connected with Cindy Sheehan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="13">They would be asked to leave if they set foot at Camp Casey II, which is on private property, the spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="14">Like many others in Crawford, Sheehan's supporters are hoping for a peaceful weekend.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">A white Republican lawmaker who contends he was excluded from a Black legislative group solely because of his race said Tuesday that the group is even more racist than the Ku Klux Klan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">&quot;My understanding is that the KKK doesn't even ban members by race,&quot; Rep. Stacey Campfield, a lawmaker from Knoxville, told The Associated Press, adding that the KKK &quot;has less racist bylaws&quot; than the black lawmakers' group.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">Earlier this year, Campfield was promptly rebuffed when he inquired about joining the Black Caucus.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="3">He had earlier said he wanted to join the group to find out how it spends its money.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">There are 18 black state lawmakers in Tennessee and Campfield's request was deemed to have been made from a &quot;strange guy&quot; who was simply interested in stirring up trouble.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">&quot;I definitely think they should allow white people in as members,&quot; Campfield said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">&quot;If we work together we might be able to pull things off and get things done.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">Tennessee Black Caucus member Rep. Larry Miller, a Democrat, said no white lawmaker has ever asked to join.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="6">He acknowledged the group's bylaws mention only black lawmakers but said it might consider admitting a white lawmaker _ not necessarily Campfield who is &quot;using this as a joke.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">Campfield posted a message on his Web journal, or blog, last week about his unsuccessful attempt to join the black lawmakers' group.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">On Saturday, under the heading &quot;I too dream,&quot; Campfield posted long excerpts from the Rev.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="8">Martin Luther King's famous 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in which King dreams of a day when his children &quot;will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">This use of King's speech infuriated some readers, and Campfield announced Monday that he was banning reader comments on his blog after some of the postings included death threats.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">&quot;People just started going crazy about it,&quot; Campfield said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">Experts on race and hate groups said Campfield hit a nerve when he used King's words to take on a black institution.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="11">It's the same tactic white separatists often use, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">&quot;Very typically these days we see white supremacists, hate groups, trying to use the words of King and other civil rights leaders to try to advance their agendas,&quot; Potok said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">On his blog, 37-year-old Campfield has also derided gay adoption and abortion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">Although Campfield said he still believes the blog is a good idea, it will now carry only his posts, along with a little biographical information _ such as his interests in judo and karate, and a listing of the Bible as his favorite book.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">``You could abort every black baby in this country, and the crime rate would go down.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">-- William Bennett, radio talk show host and former U.S. education secretary</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">WASHINGTON -- A protest demonstration is scheduled for Wednesday at the Salem Radio Network in Arlington, Va., where William Bennett works.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="3">And a boycott of the sponsors of his show is being organized.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="3">In drumming up support for these actions, one e-mailer called Bennett a racist and eugenicist and declared, ``That's how Hitler got started.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">There is a problem here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="4">But it's not Bennett, whose comments illuminated a moral inconsistency in black America that is far more harmful than anything he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="4">Forget about Bennett's absurd crime cure -- a proposal he acknowledged would be morally wrong -- and just look at the most recent analysis of abortion data, released in July by the Alan Guttmacher Institute.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="5">African-American women, who make up only 13 percent of the U.S. female population, accounted for 32 percent of the 1,293,000 abortions performed in the United States in 2002.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="6">That's 413,760 abortions performed on black women in one year -- or 1,133 a day.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="6">(In Washington, half of all pregnancies ended in abortion, a higher percentage than in any state.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="6">No outcry over that because those were just disposable fetuses, right?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="7">That is, until Bennett spoke of aborting ``black babies,'' and suddenly those fetuses become precious pre-born black people who must be saved from the evil Dr. Bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="8">It's just a different twist to the same old story.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="8">If the Ku Klux Klan were killing blacks the way blacks kill blacks, we'd be up in arms.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="8">If whites in blackface were filling the airways with degrading lyrics and minstrel shows, we'd at least shoot the TV and radio.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="8">But as along as it's just us acting a fool, who cares?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="9">This is the consequence of our corrosive moral inconsistency: a dependence on the opposition of whites to give meaning and value to black life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">Robert Woodson Sr., president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, puts it bluntly.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="10">``There are black people who share the beliefs of white supremacists and who, by their actions, concede that white people hold the keys to everything we are and can become,'' he said in a telephone interview.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="10">``The feeling is, 'Unless they change, we can't change.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="10">''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">As I've noted before, even our immune system is compromised by the stress of such a frenzied, mothlike attraction to white slights.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="11">Worst of all, we know better and still can't seem to stop ourselves.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="12">``Our health is our responsibility,'' said Jackson L. Davis III, a urologist and coordinator of men's health initiatives at the D.C. Department of Health.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="12">He spoke at a recent health conference for black men at Howard University.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="12">And he meant all aspects of our health: mental, physical, emotional and spiritual.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="13">``At health fairs, when I ask our young people what are their top health concerns, they say, 'To go to school or a party and not get shot,' '' Davis said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="14">No one at the conference jumped up to blame the white man.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="15">Atiba Coppock, an educational psychologist based in the District, called on black men to assume their responsibilities as husbands and fathers and suggested new ways to build character in our black boys.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="15">``Traditional African education focused on integrity, and we need to refocus on that,'' Coppock said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="15">``The goal was to build a person who was going to be godlike; in other words, your whole focus is to be the best person you can be spiritually, and that impacts those around you and the community in which you live.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="16">Jules P. Harrell, a professor and acting chairman of Howard's Department of Psychology, said African-Americans need to ``cultivate a new sense of body,'' one rooted in health and self-respect and not in popular culture, such as rap music videos.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="17">To that end, we might welcome the controversy about abortion and black babies and the long-overdue focus it brings to the black womb -- home to hope unbound as well as unspeakable tragedy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="17">Who is responsible for the protection and care of this amazing uterine environment, where the most wonderful fetal programming can occur just by having a loving husband kiss his pregnant wife?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="18">Bennett?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="18">Sorry, he ain't in it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">Rioting erupted Saturday in an  impoverished neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio after hundreds of  counter-protestors broke up a planned march by a neo-Nazi group,  Toledo police confirmed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">Scores of rioters rampaged through streets wrecking cars and  setting a building on fire in north Toledo after police fired tear  gas on the anti-Nazi group.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">Six people were arrested, according to Fox News.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="4">The violence broke out after a group of nearly 80 white  supremacists of the Virigina-based National Socialist Movement  assembled for a march against what they called black gang violence  against whites in the Toledo neighborhood.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">Bob White, leader of the movement, said police forced his group  to disband after the protestors gathered around them and began to  throw stones.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">&quot;The police lost total control of the situation,&quot; he told AFP.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">&quot;We were protesting black racial violence against white people  in that neighborhood,&quot; said White.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="8">But a local politician said that the multi-ethnic neighborhood  was not particularly beset by violence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="9">&quot;That neighborhood has never been known for racial tensions,&quot;  city councilman Robert McCloskey told Fox.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="1">A crowd protesting a white supremacists' march turned violent, throwing baseball-sized rocks at police, vandalizing vehicles and stores, and setting fire to a neighborhood bar, authorities said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="2">When Mayor Jack Ford and a local minister tried to calm the rioting Saturday, they were cursed for allowing the march, and Ford said a masked gang member threatened to shoot him.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="3">At least 65 people were arrested and several police officers were injured before calm was restored about four hours later.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="4">Ford blamed the rioting on gangs taking advantage of a volatile situation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="4">He declared a state of emergency, set an 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) curfew through the weekend, and asked the Highway Patrol for help.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="5">&quot;It's exactly what they wanted,&quot; Ford said of the group that planned the march, which was canceled because of the rioting.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="6">At least two dozen members of the National Socialist Movement, which calls itself &quot;America's Nazi Party,&quot; had gathered at a city park to march under police protection.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="6">Organizers said they were demonstrating against black gangs they said were harassing white residents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="7">The violence broke out about one-quarter of a mile away along the planned march route shortly before it was to begin.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="7">One group of men pounded on a convenience store, and others overturned vehicles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="7">There was a report of a shooting but police hadn't found a victim, Police Chief Mike Navarre said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="8">About 150 police officers chased bands of young men through the area.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="8">Officers wearing gas masks fired tear gas canisters and flash-bang devices designed to stun suspects, but the groups continued throwing rocks and bottles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="8">Several officers and firefighters suffered minor injuries, Navarre said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="8">At one point, the crowd reached 600 people, officials said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="9">Finally, police marched shoulder-to-shoulder down the street shouting to people to stay inside, and the crowd of several hundred broke up.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="10">At least 65 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism, failure to obey police and failure to disperse, Navarre said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="10">He said the white supremacists had left hours earlier.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="11">&quot;We frankly could have made a couple hundred arrests easily,&quot; Navarre said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="11">&quot;We just didn't have the resources on hand to arrest all of them.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="12">The mayor had appealed to residents the night before to ignore the march.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="12">He said the city wouldn't give the Nazi group a permit to march in the streets but couldn't stop them from walking on the sidewalks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="13">When the rioting began, Ford tried to negotiate with those involved, but &quot;they weren't interested in that.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="13">He said people in the crowd swore at him and wanted to know why he was protecting the Nazis.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="14">They were mostly &quot;gang members who had real or imagined grievances and took it as an opportunity to speak in their own way,&quot; Ford said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="15">&quot;I was chagrined that there were obvious mothers and children in the crowd with them,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="16">Thomas Frisch, 76, said a large group of men destroyed the exterior of a gas station next to his home of 30 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="17">&quot;A whole big gang started to come in here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="17">Next thing you know, they're jumping on the car.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="17">Then they overturned it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="17">Then they started on the building, breaking windows, ripping the bars off,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="18">Louis Ratajski, 86, and his nephew, Terry Rybczynski, left Jim &amp; Lou's Bar as a crowd gathered in front pelting police with rocks and breaking the windows.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="18">They climbed down a fire escape from the apartment where Ratajski lived over the bar and only later saw the fire on television.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="19">&quot;I was shaking.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="19">I feared for my life.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="19">Rybczynski said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="20">Keith White, a black resident, criticized city officials for allowing the march in the first place.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="21">&quot;They let them come here and expect this not to happen?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="21">said White, 29.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="22">A spokesman for the National Socialist Movement blamed police for losing control of the situation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="1">In the days leading up to a white supremacist march, ministers pleaded with residents in the predominantly black neighborhood to stay calm and community leaders organized peace rallies.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="2">Authorities even delayed releasing the route so protesters wouldn't know where the group planned to march.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="3">It wasn't enough to stop an angry mob that included gang members from looting and burning a neighborhood bar, smashing the windows of a gas station and hurling rocks and bottles at police on Saturday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="3">Twelve officers were injured, one suffering a concussion when a brick flew through her cruiser window.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="4">In all, 114 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism, failure to disperse and overnight curfew violations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="5">&quot;We knew during the preparation that it was going to be a tremendous challenge,&quot; Police Chief Mike Navarre said Sunday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="5">&quot;Anyone who would accuse us of being underprepared I would take exception with that.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="6">Much of the anger boiled over because people were upset that city leaders were willing to allow the supremacists to walk through the neighborhood and shout insults, residents and authorities said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="7">&quot;You can't allow people to come challenge a whole city and not think they weren't going to strike back,&quot; said Kenneth Allen, 47, who watched the violence begin near his home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="8">Authorities said there was little they could do to stop the group, because they did not apply for a parade permit and instead planned to walk along sidewalks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="9">&quot;They do have a right to walk on the Toledo sidewalks,&quot; said Mayor Jack Ford, who at one point confronted leaders of the mob and tried to settle them down.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="10">A gang member in a mask threatened to shoot him, and others cursed him for allowing the march, the mayor said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="10">He said he didn't know if the man who threatened him was actually armed, but he blamed gangs for much of the violence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="10">The march had been called off because of the crowds, and the white supremacists had left.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="11">If the Nazi group tries to come back, Ford said he would seek a court order to stop them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="12">Navarre said the riots escalated because members of the National Socialist Movement took their protest to the neighborhood, which is predominantly black, instead of a neutral place.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="12">&quot;If this march had occurred in downtown Toledo, we wouldn't have had the unrest,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="13">The neighborhood northwest of downtown, full of tree-lined streets and well-kept brick homes, once was a thriving Polish community.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="13">But within the last decade it's become home to poorer residents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="14">The neo-Nazi group, known as &quot;America's Nazi Party,&quot; said they came to the city because of a dispute between neighbors, one white and the other black.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="15">Police began receiving word midweek from officers on the street that gangs were going to descend on the neighborhood in protest, the police chief said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="15">The disturbances were confined to a 1-square-mile (2.6-square-kilometer) area, but the crowd swelled to about 600 people, overwhelming police.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="16">The crowds were eventually dispersed by police in riot gear after about four hours, and the mayor declared a state of emergency that remained in effect through the weekend.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="17">About 200 officers patrolled the neighborhood overnight after the riot, Navarre said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="17">Police reported no problems Sunday, but an 8 p.m. curfew was in effect for a second night.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="18">Neighbors were divided about the city allowing the march.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="19">&quot;They don't have the right to bring hate to my front yard,&quot; said Terrance Anderson, who lives near a bar that was destroyed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="20">Other neighbors said the group had a right to have their say.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="20">&quot;Too bad the people couldn't ignore them,&quot; said Dee Huntley.</sentence>
