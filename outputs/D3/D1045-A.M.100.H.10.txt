Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said in Beijing on Thursday that China has informed Russia of the water pollution situation in the river, a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian  far east and China.
He said the polluted water in the Songhua River, which reached Heilongjiang provincial capital Harbin on Thursday morning, is  expected to flow into the Heilongjiang River (called the Amur  River in Russia) on the Sino-Russian border in around 14 days  judging from the current flow speed.
