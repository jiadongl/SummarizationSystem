	<Sentences>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Immigration reform is back on the table -- with a vengeance.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Last month, House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner succeeded in attaching his Real ID Act to a must-pass Iraq appropriations bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="2">Now that spending measure is coming up in the Senate, and though it's unclear how the upper chamber will handle the congressman's proposal, members are girding for an all-out fight over immigration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">The Sensenbrenner legislation, tagged as a security measure, is a hodgepodge of provisions: one aimed at finishing a few miles of fence on the border near Tijuana, another raising barriers to asylum seekers who claim they are fleeing abuse in their home countries.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">But the section likely to create the most controversy would make it more difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">Already under attack from both the right and the left, it has also provoked calls for still tougher measures, including a national ID card.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">The bill's history in the House, where it passed on a 261-161 vote, holds crucial lessons for to them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">And we will not put an end to the illegal influx until we find a way to prevent employers from hiring unauthorized workers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">The unavoidable answer -- albeit deeply unpopular in this country -- is a credible ``employer verification'' system: one that replaces existing fraud-prone employment practices with a better way of ensuring that businesses hire only legal residents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="6">And even some policymakers who favor a temporary worker program are beginning to think this might require some sort of employee ID.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">Most Americans detest that idea, to put it mildly.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="7">We relish our privacy, we bristle at government interference in business -- and obviously any effort to prevent hiring one kind of worker will mean monitoring all hiring.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="7">Though the idea of creating national databases has grown more acceptable since 9/11, the mere mention of worker ID cards is still enough, in most circles, to end all discussion of an employment-based strategy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">It's hardly surprising that the last time we tried an employer-based approach -- penalties against businesses that hire illegal workers are part of the landmark Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) that Congress passed in 1986 -- it was so watered down as to be all but irrelevant.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">Still, unappealing as it may sound, an employer-verification system is e currently allowed): updated Social Securit y cards, driver's licenses, temporary worker's visas and green cards.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="8">But any employee need produce only one.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="8">The cards would have to have photos.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="8">Ideally, the Department of Homeland Security would coordinate with the Social Security Administration so that the only other information required would be a Social Security number, which in the future could be embedded in all four types of cards.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">As with credit card verification, responses would have to come in real time, and employers would learn only one thing about employees: whether they are authorized to work or not.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">Existing databases would have to be vastly improved: The 10-year-old pilot program that some businesses already use to verify workers' identities still produces far too many false hits, though the number is declining.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="9">As with credit histories, employees who were denied work would have access to their records and an easy-to-use appeals process.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">Equally important, the new system must be phased in over time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="10">We might start with temporary workers only, or with one sector -- say, agriculture.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="10">Companies -- especially small companies -- that wished to continue with the current paper-based method would be permitted to do so.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="10">Any expansion of the program would be tied to proof that it was working well.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="10">And of course it would hardly make sense except in the context of immigration reform that provided U.S. industries reliant on foreign laborers with enough legal workers to function and grow.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">None of this will be easy, and the public is right to be skeptical.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="11">But in the long run, if it's done properly, a program of this kind would benefit everyone.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="11">Employers would get the workers they need with much less trouble -- the current paper-based system is notoriously cumbersome -- and more peace of mind.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">Authorized immigrants would welcome a card they could rely on, and they would face less discrimination than they are currently exposed to.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">As for American workers, we would have no less privacy than we have now.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="12">We already provide this information when we get hired for a new job.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="12">The only difference under the new system is that it would happen electronically.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">As it is, most Americans defy the law every day, many of us several times, benefiting one way or another from the work of illegal immigrants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="13">We all say this is unacceptable; we say we want change.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="13">But ending the illegality is going to take more than a few miles of new fence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="13">Do we want a working system, economically realistic but also airtight?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="13">Are we prepared to do what it takes to secure our borders and restore the rule of law?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">Think about it -- think about both the costs and the benefits -- the next time you use your credit card.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">-- Tamar Jacoby is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and editor of ``Reinventing the Melting Pot: The New Immigrants and What It Means to Be American'' (Basic Books).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">WASHINGTON - Congress is poised to pass a law that would make sweeping changes to the nation's system for issuing driver's licenses by imposing stringent requirements on states to verify the authenticity of birth certificates, Social Security cards, legal residency visas, and bank and utility records used to obtain a license.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">House Republicans attached the bill to a must-pass supplemental spending package for troops in Iraq without first putting it through the usual legislative scrutiny of hearings and debate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="2">Should it emerge intact from House-Senate negotiations over the spending package, it could be law next month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">Touted as an antiterrorism measure, the &quot;Real ID Act&quot; would also overturn laws in nine states that allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">If a state does not comply with any provision of the law, its residents would no longer be able to use their driver's licenses for federal identification purposes, such as for boarding a plane.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">The law, some say, would effectively turn the new driver's license into a national identification card.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">Its chief champion, House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, says the measure would help prevent terrorists from fraudulently gaining official documents that would allow them to enter the country and move freely.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">Another set of provisions would significantly raise the standard of proof that asylum applicants must meet when claiming that they have been persecuted on ethnic, religious, or political grounds.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">It would also grant greater discretion to Homeland Security officials to reject asylum seekers and curtail the ability of appeals courts to issue stays of deportation orders and review rejected cases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">Terrorists have &quot;used almost every conceivable means of entering the country,&quot; Sensenbrenner said in a statement provided by an aide.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">&quot;They have come as students, tourists, and business visitors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="6">They have also been [legal permanent residents] and naturalized US citizens.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="6">They have snuck across the border illegally, arrived as stowaways on ships, used false passports, and have been granted amnesty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="6">Terrorists have even used America's humanitarian tradition of welcoming those seeking asylum.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="6" para="6">We must plug these gaps.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">But many critics of the Real ID Act say that it goes too far and that its language is riddled with problems that might have been corrected through the normal legislative review process.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">&quot;This bill has not received a single hearing in either chamber of Congress, so the challenges it presents for states have never received any attention,&quot; said Cheye Calvo of the National Conference of State Legislatures.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">&quot;It does much more than just deny driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">State legislators and governors say that the Real ID Act would lead to horrific delays at motor vehicle bureaus, that it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than Congress thinks, and that it would impose an unrealistic three-year deadline for having the verification system in place.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">Moreover, civil libertarians argue that by creating uniform national standards for driver's licenses and requiring states to pool driver information in a national database, the bill is a back-door move to creating a national identification card, which they oppose on privacy grounds.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">And immigrant advocates fear the asylum changes are too draconian and will hurt people with legitimate claims of persecution.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">But Sensenbrenner is pushing hard to keep the measure on the final Iraq spending bill, and his opinion carries special weight in Congress.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="12">Republican leaders promised him last December that the Real ID Act would get a quick hearing in 2005 after he agreed to remove it from a major intelligence overhaul bill that the Bush administration needed to pass.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">Moreover, political observers say the Bush administration is unwilling to antagonize Sensenbrenner because, as Judiciary Committee chairman, he will hold sway over President Bush's proposal to reform the immigration system by establishing a system of guest worker visas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">&quot;They're going to stick it on the supplemental, and it's going to stay on there,&quot; Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="14">&quot;It's a terrible piece of legislation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="14">...</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="14">They put it on a supplemental, which they knew you couldn't stop.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="14">I've had a senator come to me and say, 'We're going to filibuster this.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="6" para="14">I said, 'Get real.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="7" para="14">It's not going to happen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="8" para="14">It's a defense bill.&quot;'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">Six Republican senators last week expressed similar concerns when they signed a letter asking Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, not to let the Real ID Act appear in the final bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="15">They were led by Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a lawmaker close to evangelical Christian groups who are particularly concerned about the asylum provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">&quot;Legislating in such a complex area without the benefit of hearings and expert testimony is a dubious exercise and one that subverts the Senate's deliberative process,&quot; said the letter, which was also signed by Republicans John McCain of Arizona, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, and Richard Lugar of Indiana.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">Jeff Lungren, a Sensenbrenner spokesman, Monday rejected the notion that the bill could use further debate, arguing that the policy proposals contained in the Real ID Act have been public since Sensenbrenner tried unsuccessfully to include them in the 2004 intelligence overhaul law.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">&quot;Since that [intelligence] bill passed about five months or so ago, this issue has continued to be at the forefront,&quot; Lungren said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="18">&quot;Just because some senators have chosen not to address it and to ignore it doesn't mean that we don't need to have these provisions and bolster our border security now.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">Cory Smith, who has been tracking the asylum provisions for Human Rights First, called Lungren's comments &quot;disingenuous.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">&quot;I'm sure at some place somewhere years ago something about asylum was brought up, but there were no hearings on this,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="20">&quot;There has not been careful consideration of these serious changes to asylum law and immigration policy.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">Calvo and Lungren also sparred over how much the driver's licensing provisions would cost.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="22">Lungren pointed to a $100 million estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="22">But Calvo said the real amount is more likely to be between $500 million and $700 million when the cost of such items as new equipment to tap into national databases is included.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="23">Tim Sparapani, ACLU legislative counsel, said the Real ID Act's rules would result in a de facto national identification card because it would require states to pool driver data in a national database.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="24">&quot;When you condition travel on an identification card and create an internal registry of citizens and a way to track them, that is entirely contrary to most Americans' understandings of the way their country works and should work,&quot; Sparapani said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">A MISTAKEN ID BILL CONGRESS IS in danger of passing legislation that could damage immigration policy under the false pretense of enhancing national security.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="1">The Senate should block this ill-conceived proposal and take a more measured look at immigration reform.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">House Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin says his bill, the Real ID Act, will keep terrorists from crossing US borders.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="2">In a January column he writes: &quot;The goal of the Real ID Act is straightforward: it seeks to prevent another 9/11-type attack by disrupting terrorist travel.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">But the rhetoric promises more protection than the bill delivers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">A key feature of the bill is the denial of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="4">But most of the illegal immigrants who get licenses in the nine states that grant them are trying to earn a living, not commit terrorist acts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="4">The real challenge is figuring out how to manage undocumented drivers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="4" para="4">Mass deportation is unlikely because many of these drivers are essential to America's economy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="5" para="4">They are vital in various industries, including the business of getting food into grocery stores.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">Sensenbrenner's bill would compel states to add security features to all driver's licenses and create a license database that other states could access.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="5">This would essentially create a national ID card, an idea that should be thoroughly debated on its own, not slipped through a back door.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">If it passes, the Real ID Act could cause delays in motor vehicle registry offices as states scramble to meet the new requirements.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="6">Residents of states that fail to comply could find that their licenses are useless as IDs at airports, grounding people unless they have passports to use as identification.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">The Real ID Act would also demand more proof from asylum seekers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="7">Government officials could ask for &quot;corroborating evidence.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="7">This is overkill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="4" para="7">Many victims of torture and abuse are unlikely to be able to provide such evidence, especially if they come from countries where law enforcement officials are blind to, or complicit in, abuses.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">Sensenbrenner calls for more barriers and surveillance technology along the southern US border.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="8">Illegal immigration should be discouraged.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="8">But this bill ignores the real need for laws that let immigrant workers travel safely and legally between the United States and Mexico.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">Sensenbrenner introduced the Real ID Act in January.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="9">Last month the House attached the act to an emergency spending bill for Iraq and other needs, forcing the Senate to consider it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">House and Senate conferees are meeting now to reconcile their versions of the spending bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="10">They should leave the Real ID Act on the cutting room floor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="10">It offers false security instead of intelligent reform.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">It's crunch time on a major piece of immigration legislation and all sides are stepping up the pressure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">The Real ID Act, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses and tightens asylum laws, is expected to be approved or rejected by House and Senate negotiators Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">Proponents of the measure -- including a group of immigration control activists in town for a week of lobbying -- said they were cautiously optimistic, especially after the White House endorsed it in a letter to House and Senate conferees earlier this week.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">&quot;We feel pretty good about it,&quot; said Carlos Espinosa, spokesman for Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., a leading critic of illegal immigration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, said that negotiations on the Real ID Act &quot;are going well&quot; and involved the leadership in both chambers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that Democrats have been &quot;completely shut out of the backroom negotiations&quot; in &quot;yet another example of the Republican leadership's abuse of power.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">&quot;This legislation would make sweeping, controversial changes to our laws with respect to the environment, refugees, judicial review, the states' power to make decisions about their own laws, and other issues,&quot; Reid said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">&quot;This legislation has never been considered by the Senate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="7">It has not been subjected to any hearings, debate, amendments, or any votes at all by this body.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">Other opponents of the immigration measure -- including immigrant advocates, religious groups, human rights organizations, the National Conference of State Legislators, and the American Civil Liberties Union -- were trying hard to stop it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">Several of the groups were planning a telephone conference call on Thursday to urge lawmakers to drop the legislation from a larger emergency spending bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">&quot;This country has been known to have safe haven for people, and we're fearful that, with this measure, that won't happen,&quot; said Judith Golub, senior director of advocacy and public affairs of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">House and Senate negotiators are working to reconcile two versions of the emergency spending bill, one of which includes the immigration provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="11">The bill is urgently needed to fund military operations and rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as tsunami relief efforts in Asia.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">The Real ID Act was added to the spending bill in the House in an effort spearheaded by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="12">The Senate version did not include the immigration provisions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licenses to confirm their legal status in the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="13">The residents of states that don't comply won't be allowed to use the driver's licenses as identification to board planes or apply for Social Security and other benefits.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">Proponents say the measure would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver's licenses which they could use to travel in the United States and would also stop terrorists from taking advantage of U.S. asylum laws.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">Opponents say that the Real ID Act is an anti-immigrant measure that would not improve security and hasn't been vetted through the congressional process.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">Critics say the measure would result in more dangerous roadways, with thousands of illegal immigrants driving without licenses or insurance.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union says that a provision in the bill to link state driver's license databases would create a de facto national ID card and a &quot;show us your papers&quot; society.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">The driver's licence issue has energized groups upset about illegal immigration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="18">Some are in Washington this week for a six-day lobbying effort on various immigration topics.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="18">It includes a gathering of 18 radio talk-show hosts from around the country.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="19">At a press conference Tuesday hosted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates reducing immigration, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said that illegal immigration is &quot;threatening to our very survival as a nation&quot; because it brings down wages and &quot;destroys our health care and education system.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="20">&quot;They don't deserve a drivers license, they deserve to be driven to the border,&quot; and thrown over, said Rohrabacher, a nine-term lawmaker who chairs a science subcommittee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="21">The comment drew raucous applause and cheers from the crowd of about 150 people.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">A bill that would enact hotly contested immigration rules, including one that would bar illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses, is marching toward approval with the backing of the White House.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">The provisions are attached to an emergency spending bill that would provide $81 billion for military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">A bipartisan House-Senate conference committee is expected to agree on a compromise version of the bill today; each chamber is slated to vote on the measure within the next two weeks and then send it to President Bush for his signature.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">The immigration provisions, which were introduced as the Real ID Act in January, include new identification requirements for people seeking driver's licenses, toughened standards for immigrants seeking asylum in the United States, and money to complete a three-mile stretch of border fencing near San Diego.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">The House version contains the immigration provisions but the Senate's version does not.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">Lawmakers from both parties, as well as civil liberties groups and immigration advocates, decry the addition of the provisions to the must-pass supplemental bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="6">Supporters of the provisions know that it would be politically unwise for anyone to vote against a bill that sends money to American soldiers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">Furthermore, high-level lobbying by the Real ID measures' author, Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. James Sensenbrenner, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and the White House helped silence discussion of handling the provisions as separate legislation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">In a letter to Congress dated Monday, Joshua Bolten, director of the Office of Management and Budget, strongly encouraged Congress to include the immigration provisions and said the legislation would &quot;strengthen the ability of the United States to protect against terrorist entry into and activities within the United States.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">Some experts say the president's support for the tough immigration provisions sends mixed messages.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="9">He also is pushing a temporary guest worker program to make it easier for illegal immigrants to work in the United States and is working hard to improve U.S.-Mexico relations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">&quot;We think that the long-term future of North America is more ties between communities, but when we see fences going up, it seems to send the wrong message,&quot; said Nestor Rodriguez, co-director of the Center for Immigration Research at the University of Houston.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="11">Some lawmakers, including Houston Republican Rep. John Culberson, a staunch advocate of stronger immigration controls, are completely dedicated to making sure the provisions remain in the bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="12">&quot;Stopping the flood of illegal immigrants and protecting our borders is my single highest legislative priority,&quot; Culberson said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="12">&quot;We need action now, and the only sure way to enact immigration change is to attach it to an emergency spending bill.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="13">Indeed, Culberson said he and his allies in the House would vote against the military spending bill if the immigration provisions are removed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="14">&quot;We would bring it down if we need to,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="14">&quot;I would in two heartbeats.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="14">I am fed up with the complete lack of enforcement of our immigration laws.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="18">The provisions also would raise the standard of proof that asylum applicants must meet if they claim that they have been persecuted on ethnic, religious or political grounds in their home countries.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="19">The asylum rules are unnecessary, said Joseph Vail, a former immigration judge and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Houston Law Center.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="20">&quot;The standards are already extremely high,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="20">&quot;There is not one example of a terrorist having been granted asylum.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">The measure, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses and tightens U.S. asylum laws, was approved by House and Senate negotiators Tuesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="2">It is part of an $82 billion emergency spending bill to fund military operations and rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as tsunami relief efforts in Asia.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">Cheye Calvo, director of the Transportation Committee of the National Conference of State Legislators said the driver's license measure would cause chaos and backlogs in thousands of department of motor vehicle offices across the country, making the nation less secure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">&quot;I don't think Congress really knows what they are mandating,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">&quot;This bill imposes significant new burdens that will affect all Americans, anyone who has to go to the DMV is affected by this bill.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">Some state DMV offices showed a lower level of concern about the legislation, saying that they already comply with many of the provisions, but that implementaion of the entire proposal could be time consuming and costly.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">Proponents of the measure, dubbed the REAL ID Act, dismissed Calvo's predictions as exaggerations from a special interest group and say that the bill would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver's licenses that they could use to travel in the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, which spearheaded the REAL ID Act, said that the states that will be most affected are the ones doing poorly in verifying identification documents, including nine &quot;problem&quot; states--Wisconsin, Oregon, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Washington, Hawaii and Montana.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">If the states refuse to comply with the new law, they &quot;will become even more of a haven for terrorists and illegal aliens to get their driver's licenses,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licenses to confirm their legal status in the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="10">The residents of states that don't comply won't be allowed to use the driver's licenses as identification to board planes or apply for Social Security and other federal benefits.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">Calvo said that language currently in the bill would require states to verify the authenticity of each identification document -- including birth certificates and utility bills, with the original sources.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">This would require states, within three years, to upgrade 3,000 departments of motor vehicle offices, train workers, and add employees to handle all the extra phone calls to utility companies, immigration offices, and 30,000 vital records offices, some of which are small and don't have any full time employees, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">The National Conference of State Legislators has estimated that this effort would cost $500 million.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">&quot;State budgets, in many cases, are already in dire straits.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="18">&quot;We have a very secure Georgia driver's license to begin with,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="19">Georgia does not, however, verify each birth certificate with the original source, instead relying on the certification on each document, she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="19">Such a process could take time and states would hope for federal funding to help, Sports said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="20">It took about a year to implement a real time verification system for Social Security numbers, she added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="21">Tom Vinger, spokesman with the Texas Department of Public Safety, said that the department was monitoring the REAL ID legislation &quot;with great interest,&quot; but he didn't want to comment until a final bill was passed.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="23">Frank Panela, spokesman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety &amp; Motor Vehicles, said that Florida has no problem with the REAL ID Act, because the state already implements most of the new rules.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="24">&quot;We are already way ahead of the game,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="25">Florida has a document identification system for Social Security cards, passports, immigration documents and other documents that have certain security features.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="26">Fred Stratmann, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles, said that the state would have &quot;minor implementation issues&quot; to comply with the new measure, including upgrading computers to store digital copies of identification documents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="27">&quot;Ohio is in very good shape in implementing what the law requires,&quot; he said.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="4">Unfortunately, it likely will take another commission report before lawmakers get behind a nationwide identity program.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">In 1995, the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, concluded that immigration laws and employer sanctions could never be enforced without some form of secure national ID cards and with an accompanying database of citizens and others who are in the country legally.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">Congress long has ignored notices that the United States needs a standardized method to be able to identify and track people who commit crimes in one state and easily take up residence and new identities in another state.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">Not only do criminals often avoid justice because of a lack of standardized identification, citizens also avoid court orders for child support, custody laws and many other situations simply by skipping out to another state.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="10">These inexpensive identity papers can include bogus Social Security cards, birth certificates, check-cashing cards and driver's licenses -- all available in most cities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="11">The 9/11 Commission Report called for a secure, standardized national identification system as a way to reduce the threat of terrorism and improve homeland security.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="11">That's a valid consideration, of course, since national security must always be at the top of the list of national priorities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="12">Terrorism and homeland security issues aside, however, the principle of the rule of law erodes in the United States when the government fails to enforce the law that prohibits U.S. employers from hiring workers who are illegally inside the United States.</sentence>
