		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Last month, Adelphia Communications became the first American cable company to offer its subscribers triple-X-rated pornography.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="1">Adelphia's role as porn pioneer struck some as a bit unlikely: Five years ago the company had dropped Spice, a popular softcore pornography channel, because the company's since-disgraced founder and CEO, John Rigas, found it offensive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="1">Asked about the reversal, a company spokeswoman replied succinctly, &quot;People want it, so we are trying to provide it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="1">The more Xs, the more popular.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Indeed, revenues from pay-per-view and video-on-demand adult movies have quadrupled since the late 1990s as cable operators have started airing more explicit erotic material.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="2">And it's not just cable television that's embraced the truly lewd.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="2">Movies like &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and the recent documentary &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot; have portrayed the adult industry as an enclave for good-hearted, rough-edged misfits and cultural freedom fighters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="2">Last fall the memoir of porn superstar Jenna Jameson spent a month and a half on the New York Times bestseller list.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="2">And the industry itself continues to grow at a torrid pace: Hard numbers are difficult to find, but estimates put it at anywhere from a $3 billion to $14 billion a year industry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">In response, a predictable political debate has emerged, with cultural conservatives standing athwart the tide yelling &quot;Stop!&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="3">while left-leaning civil libertarians brandish the First Amendment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="3">But there's a voice that's been conspicuously absent in the current debate: anti-pornography feminists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">In &quot;Inside Deep Throat,&quot; it is prominent feminists like Gloria Steinem and Susan Brownmiller, as much as decency crusaders like Charles Keating, who get credit for shutting down the nationwide porn party that &quot;Deep Throat&quot; kicked off in 1972.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">&quot;The worst censors in the country,&quot; Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says in an onscreen interview, &quot;were the feminists.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="4">The characterization is of a piece with the documentary's cartoony glibness.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="4">Still, today, as social conservatives lead the campaign to rid the airwaves of the taint of sex, it's easy to forget that the most powerful anti-pornography legislation ever passed in this country was written not by cultural conservatives but radical feminists led by legal scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and author Andrea Dworkin.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">MacKinnon and Dworkin's efforts depended on support from notorious bluenoses like Phyllis Schlafly and former attorney general Edwin Meese.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">But the two women's brief against pornography went beyond simply attacking its lasciviousness.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="5">They argued that its aestheticized visions of female degradation actually incited men to violence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="5">In 1974 the writer and activist Robin Morgan had put it most starkly: &quot;Pornography is the theory, rape is the practice.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">MacKinnon and Dworkin's antipornography statutes-which passed in Indianapolis and Bellingham, Wash., and were defeated in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Cambridge-made little use of obscenity standards and instead reframed the issue as one of sex discrimination.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="6">While their bills didn't ban porn outright, they allowed women to sue pornographers for damages.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">And those damages, the anti-porn feminists argued, weren't merely abstract.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="7">During the debates over the local ordinances, and in testimony before Edwin Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1985, MacKinnon and others arranged for often horrifying testimony by women on the physical and mental abuse they had suffered either in the making of pornography or at the hands of men they claimed had been inspired by it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="7">Some of the most dramatic testimony was from Linda Lovelace, star of &quot;Deep Throat.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">So what happened to those voices?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">Now a law professor at the University of Michigan, MacKinnon has a new book out this month, &quot;Women's Lives, Men's Laws&quot; (Belknap), which includes essays and speeches on pornography, but in recent years she and Dworkin seem to have lost not just the legal battle but the cultural war.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="8">These days, &quot;sex-positive&quot; feminists like Laura Kipnis or Camille Paglia tend to get the airtime.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="8">And in the universities, women's studies scholars are more likely to do close readings of the aesthetics and politics of pornography than to march in favor of banning it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">Even at the time, MacKinnon and Dworkin's campaign sharply split the feminist movement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">While supported by leading figures like Steinem and Brownmiller, the Indianapolis law in particular galvanized others in opposition.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="9">They formed the Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce, or FACT.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="9">When the law's constitutionality was being decided by a federal appeals court, FACT submitted an amicus brief-signed by Betty Friedan, Rita Mae Brown, Kate Millet, Adrienne Rich and others-opposing it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">Torn between the conflicting arguments, the National Organization of Women was unable to take a position.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="10">MacKinnon's description of her opponents, in a 1987 speech, was typical of the heated rhetoric: &quot;The Black movement has Uncle Toms and Oreo cookies.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="10">The labor movement had scabs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="10">The women's movement has FACT.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">Starting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began to see porn as a tool that women could appropriate to liberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="11">Porn sexuality, they argued, wasn't simply about subjugation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="11">Instead, &quot;what pornography is trying to do is create, using real bodies, a fantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure,&quot; says Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="11">What others might see as basically a masturbatory aid was cast instead as a genre of utopian social criticism.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="11">As for the anti-porn crusaders, Williams adds: &quot;Really, who are they to tell us where our sexual imaginations should go?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">So it was a deeply divided feminist movement that faced the failure of MacKinnon and Dworkin's laws, not only in places like Los Angeles and Cambridge, but when they were eventually struck down by federal courts in both Indiana and Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">As Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who has studied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it, &quot;A lot of the energy that went into the issue during the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="12">When they failed, he says, &quot;It became pretty clear that legal regulations directed to stop pornography were not going to be accepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some of the energy from the anti-pornography movement.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">Even where they did survive, the laws had unintended and often crudely ironic consequences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="13">In Canada, which in 1992 adopted MacKinnon and Dworkin's definition of pornography, it was used largely to prosecute gay and lesbian bookstores and even to seize copies of two of Dworkin's books because they &quot;illegally eroticized pain and bondage.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">Today, Mackinnon bristles at the old charge that anti-porn feminists were, in effect, in bed with the political right.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="14">&quot;I actually know who I'm in bed with,&quot; she said in a recent interview.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="14">&quot;This was just something created by the pornographers to scare liberals off, which doesn't take much.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">But her language has been adopted by some on the right.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="15">Now, according to Janet LaRue of Concerned Women for America, &quot;It may be that we're not hearing as much from the traditional hardline feminist organizations, but when I write and speak on the topic of pornography, one of the aspects that I point out is that it certainly subjugates and degrades women and reduces us to the sum or our body parts.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">But perhaps it's porn's very ubiquity that has most weakened the anti-pornography case, feminist and conservative.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="16">Thanks to the growth of home-video pornography in the 1980s and the more recent shift to the Internet, far more people have access to X-rated material than ever before.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="16">As Williams puts it, &quot;In a way I think MacKinnon and Dworkin were able to invoke the kind of horror that they did at pornography at a time when not as many people had seen it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="16">For better or for worse, now it has become part of the vernacular of our way of talking about picturing sex to ourselves.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="17">MacKinnon agrees, though she sees the shift as more insidious: &quot;The data just show that pornography sets community standards, so the more pornography there is, the less will be seen to be wrong with it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="17">It's just its own intrinsic dynamic.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">Despite the recent backlash against television indecency, pornography prosecutions remain rare.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="18">The Bush administration has picked up the pace from the Clinton administration, creating a special anti-porn unit in the Department of Justice and hiring Bruce Taylor, the prosecutor who went after Larry Flynt in 1981, as its porn czar.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="18">Last month, the Justice Department announced that it would appeal a recent decision by a federal judge that declared federal obscenity laws unconstitutional.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="18">And speaking earlier this week, the new attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, listed &quot;the aggressive prosecution of purveyors of obscene materials&quot; among his top priorities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Still, Frederick Schauer, a First Amendment scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, points out that &quot;criminal obscenity prosecutions have come close to disappearing, they're constitutionally permissible but almost nonexistent....</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="19">The legal definition of obscenity remains very, very, very narrow.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">As for MacKinnon, since the early 1990s she has focused on international issues like prostitution, human trafficking, and war crimes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="20">(In 2000, she won a war crimes conviction against the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic for the rape of Muslim and Croat women during the Bosnian War.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="20">But she says pornography is still a central issue for her.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">&quot;Until a problem is solved, it's always a good time to solve it,&quot; she says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="21">&quot;Whether people want to solve it is another question.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Hillary '08.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="1">The inevitability campaign now underway demonstrates everything bad about modern American politics.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">Two months into George W. Bush's second term as president, a cadre of Hillary Clinton supporters is trying to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination for New York's junior senator.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="2">One supporter is her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who declares that his wife would make an excellent president.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="2">Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware also predicts &quot;she is likely to be the nominee.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">So, case closed?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">No other Democrats need apply?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="3">That is ridiculous.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">For once, some political insiders are trying to put the fix in for a woman for president.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">But a smoke-filled room of political power brokers handpicking a female presidential nominee is no more appealing than one that selects one of the boys.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="4">And it is likely to be just as inefficient when it comes to choosing a winner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">Democratic loyalists exerted all their influence to derail former Vermont governor Howard Dean and make Massachusetts Senator John Kerry the party nominee in 2004.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">With help from Dean and voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, they succeeded.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="5">Then Kerry lost in November.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">Hillary Clinton has a strong case to make to Democrats and independents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">She is a celebrity politician who can raise money.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="6">Early polls put her ahead of Kerry and other Democratic presidential hopefuls.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="6">Results from one recent poll showed that six in 10 voters believe that the United States is ready for a female president, and 53 percent thought Hillary Clinton should try for the job.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">She has the next three years to build her case {ndash} and so should other Democrats with different ideas about party direction and agenda.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">As a couple, the Clintons are skilled at political repositioning.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">Right now it's all about grabbing the middle, as defined by the 2004 presidential election.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">Hillary Clinton went public with the view that avoiding abortion is the correct goal for prochoice advocates.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="9">She reached out to religious conservatives with an endorsement of faith-based initiatives.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="9">With her 2006 reelection campaign approaching, she is wooing New York Republicans.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="9">She backs the Bush doctrine in Iraq.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">As for Bill Clinton, at the request of President George W. Bush, he is leading the US tsunami relief effort with former President George H.W.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="10">Bush.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="10">On their tour of tsunami damage in Southeast Asia, Clinton allowed the elder Bush to sleep on the plane's only bed while he stretched out on the floor, according to Newsweek.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="10">In this instance, Clinton's dedication to the cause could be viewed as a political two-fer: tsunami relief and Hillary '08.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="10">It projects a beautiful photo-op to red state America.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="6" para="10">But is it beautiful enough to make Clinton-haters forget why they hate the Clintons?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">To believe that is naive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="11">It also fails to acknowledge the GOP's well-established path to victory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="11">Republican campaign strategists create their own image of the Democratic challenger; they do not accept the image promoted by the opposition.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="11">The GOP-inspired image is seared into voters' minds through relentless advertising, talking points, and conservative talking heads.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="11">So far, Democrats have not come up with a successful antidote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">In 2004, Republicans {ndash} with help from the Democratic candidate {ndash} made sure the Democratic nominee was John Kerry, flip-flopper and Vietnam War protester, not John Kerry, political centrist and Vietnam War hero.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">If Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee in 2008, the GOP will run against Hillary Clinton as defined by the GOP, not as defined by the Democratic Party.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">In the end, the Clintons may be resilient and resourceful enough to beat back Republican spin doctors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="14">They certainly have experience doing so.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="14">But no one should be fooled into believing that electing a woman generally and Hillary Clinton specifically will happen easily.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="14">It will take hundreds of millions of dollars, tremendous will, and ugly political warfare.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">In remarks following a recent speech at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton's alma mater, feminist Betty Friedan scoffed at the notion of a presidential face-off between two women, Clinton and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="15">&quot;It will never happen,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">It might; in politics, anything can happen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="16">But it's too early to pick a presidential candidate and way too early to try to dictate who should be a party's presidential nominee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">Joan Vennochi's e-mail address is vennochiglobe.com.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">When Judith Warner was researching her book &quot;Perfect Madness,&quot; a sharply observed study of motherhood in today's culture, the TV series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was not yet part of the zeitgeist.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">But the book and the TV soap sing an almost perfect duet of disharmony together, each from a distinct point of view.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="2">The TV character most stay-at-home moms identify with is Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), the frazzled mother who gave up her career to raise an unmanageable brood, and who feels she can never quite catch up to her life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">And that feeling is one of the threads that run through &quot;Madness,&quot; which has ridden a surge of media attention (a Newsweek cover story, two big pops on the &quot;Today&quot; show with Katie Couric) to debut at No.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="3">9 on The New York Times Bestseller List.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">&quot;There's a widespread feeling in the culture now that things have gone too far, that there's this insanity, and I think Lynette and my book both tap that feeling,&quot; Warner says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">But where the jolts of recognition in &quot;Housewives&quot; are embedded in silliness, &quot;Perfect Madness&quot; is perfectly serious, a book that strives to be an updated take on Betty Friedan's groundbreaking &quot;The Feminine Mystique.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="5">Friedan wrote about &quot;The Problem That Has No Name&quot; (but which had much to do with being desperate and a housewife), and Warner is concerned about &quot;The New Problem That Has No Name,&quot; which bundles together many things, including motherhood, perfectionism and guilt.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">&quot;That caught-by-the-throat feeling so many mothers have today of always doing something wrong,&quot; she calls it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">Warner has received a lot of response from mothers about &quot;Madness.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">&quot;I hear the positive feedback, 'cause that's what they'll tell me to my face,&quot; she says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="8">But she also has read some of the Web log responses, which cover a wide range.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">One blogger accused her of being a sniper in the &quot;Mommy Wars&quot; -- mothers criticizing other mothers for staying home, for working in an office, for using or not using day care, for being too involved or not involved enough.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">Warner disagrees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">&quot;This is not mommy bashing,&quot; Warner says of the book.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">Warner, the mother of daughters ages 4 and 7, was a Newsweek correspondent based in Paris, where she saw much more support for young mothers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="12">When she moved back to Washington, she was appalled by the parents who camped out in line to get their children into the right preschool, who medicated their children for the tiniest reason and who obsessively bought every Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart product that came out.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="13">&quot;A generation of control freaks&quot; she calls them in the book.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="13">She is both one of them herself, she acknowledges, and an observer, apart.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="14">An example, she says, is occupational therapy for preschoolers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="14">&quot;I don't know about the rest of the country,&quot; she said, &quot;but in New York and Washington, D.C., tons and tons of kids are in OT to work on their fine motor skills.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="14">You have schools where practically every 4-year-old boy is in OT to improve his handwriting and scissor skills.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="4" para="14">Anyone with a grain of common sense knows this is excessive.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="15">The overall tone of &quot;Madness&quot; is sympathetic to moms.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="16">But Warner can be critical of &quot;hyperparenting,&quot; and she finds plenty of other groups to criticize for the mom madness, including:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="17">The media.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="17">Especially magazines that seem obsessed with chronicling what some call &quot;the work-life balance&quot; -- articles that Warner says can make mothers feel inadequate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="17">&quot;Nearly every story comes with a message: You can take control,&quot; she writes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="18">Husbands, for obvious reasons.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="18">She recounts excerpts from the interviews she conducted with several hundred women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="18">The anger and frustration over how little men help with child-rearing comes pouring out.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="4" para="18">&quot;I have learned that I am basically going it alone,&quot; one woman tells her -- sounding exactly like Lynette.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="19">Advocates of all stripes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="19">&quot;The culture wars between social conservatives and feminists, which take place far from the concerns of most Americans,&quot; she writes, &quot;are a huge and terrible waste of resources.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="19">They have left women holding the bag, with virtually nothing to show for themselves, after three decades of women's 'liberation' and of New Right 'family values' activism.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="20">Society.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="20">&quot;It's really your country -- and not your child, not your family, not yourself -- that is entirely out of control,&quot; she writes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="20">She argues for a nonpartisan agenda of social changes that would include affordable and high-quality day care, health care for part-time workers and their families, and incentives for businesses with pro-family policies, saying most of that could be accomplished with changes in the tax laws.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="21">&quot;I kept the political part of it really short, to about a chapter,&quot; she says, &quot;but I've been shocked by the extent people are interested in the policy implications.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="22">&quot;We need to start looking critically at family dynamics -- the stress, the perpetual motion, the anxiety.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="22">My critique is primarily aimed at society, not at mothers.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">These days, many Gen-X and Gen-Y mothers are experiencing that same discontent.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">&quot;You become so absorbed in 'attachment parenting,' you put so much effort into it that you're lucky to get a shower,&quot; says Anne-Marie Nichols, 40, of Firestone, who writes the newsletter for the national organization MOTHERS (Mothers Ought to Have Equal Rights.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">A former marketing copywriter, she's now full-time mom to two toddlers and president of the board of directors of a charter school.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="4">She believes that her generation, unlike the one that came of age in the 1960s and '70s, has failed to create social change for women through political action.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">&quot;After a certain point you think, 'Who cares how people voted?'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">Your husband is yelling at you, there's no clean underwear, you didn't get to the store, and there are piles of laundry all over.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">But in the past few years, a handful of organizations have begun to forge what's called &quot;The 21st Century Mothers Movement.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">Forget getting husbands to do more housework.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">They want sweeping social change, a pro-mother political agenda that would eliminate policies and practices that unfairly affect women as caregivers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">They advocate for affordable day care, tax breaks for corporations that allow mothers to work part time, and laws that provide health-care benefits.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">&quot;Motherhood remains the crucial unfinished business of the women's movement,&quot; says Susan Douglas, author of &quot;The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined Women.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">But there's significant disagreement over the need for changing the system to help mothers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">&quot;We emphasize the importance of motherhood,&quot; says Janice Crouse, senior fellow of the think tank Concerned Women of America in Washington, D.C., which works to bring biblical principles into public policy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">She agrees that motherhood is extremely stressful, with a litany of demands ranging from high-pressured kids' activities to impossible standards of perfection.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">&quot;But it seems to me that, once again, they are looking for a governmental solution -- for someone else to solve their problems,&quot; says Crouse.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">As a mother of grown children, she says, &quot;There were days that I wondered if I would survive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="14">I very definitely identify with what they call 'mommy madness.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="14">But there's a sense of unrealistic expectations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">&quot;We can't as women speak out both sides of our mouth.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="15">On one hand, ask to be taken seriously and considered rational, intellectual beings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="15">And on the other hand, say 'Oh my goodness, I can't cope, this is too hard, someone's got to help me.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">&quot;I feel like saying, 'You're a grown woman.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="16">Take control of your schedule.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="16">If you can't manage that, you can't manage a company or a very demanding career.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">In her new book &quot;Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety,&quot; Judith Warner also criticizes the emerging mother's movement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="17">Her complaint is that it's unfocused and ineffective.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">But pioneers of the movement refuse to quit.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="18">They target what they consider inflexible workplace practices and outdated policies, which they believe increase the odds that mothers will experience financial insecurity and diminished well-being over a lifetime.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="19">&quot;A 'perfect storm' of unfavorable economic and social conditions harms all women who mother, but the consequences are most severe for low-income mothers, single-parent mothers and mothers of color,&quot; said Judith Stadtman Tucker, at a recent conference on motherhood in Toronto.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="20">To reach the tipping point will require an &quot;open discourse about the new future of motherhood,&quot; said Tucker, who is editor and founder of The Mothers Movement Online.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="21">Evidence of this dialogue percolating in pop culture includes blogger moms, mama-zines, Web sites, e-newsletters, and a deluge of trendy &quot;momoirs&quot; -- memoirs written by mothers.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="23">&quot;We are in a consciousness-raising mode right now.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="24">In February, Newsweek ran a cover story on the myth of the perfect mother, based on Warner's book.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="24">She described a &quot;nationwide epidemic&quot; of &quot;craziness&quot; in which 70 percent of American moms find motherhood &quot;incredibly stressful.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="25">This brings to mind, she wrote, &quot;Betty Friedan's 1963 classic, 'The Feminine Mystique.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="25">The diffuse dissatisfaction.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="25">The angst, hidden behind all the obsession with trivia, and the push to be perfect ... And the tendency, every bit as pronounced among my peers as it had been for the women Friedan interviewed -- to blame themselves for their problems.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="26">The story triggered more than 600 letters from grateful readers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="27">&quot;This generation of women isn't like (that of) the '60s, which protested and tried to change things,&quot; says Laura Nevitt, president of the Denver chapter of Mothers &amp; More.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="28">&quot;I read that piece and thought, 'This is so me!'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="28">I look at myself, and focus on what I am not doing instead of trying to get other people to help me.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="28">I'm trying to be so self-sufficient.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="29">Modern mothers aren't just isolated, Warner argued.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="29">They also are bred to rely on their own initiative, and to privatize their problems.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="30">A few months earlier, an episode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; targeted the problem.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="30">Lynette, the stay-at-home mother of four hellacious children, has a meltdown and runs away.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="30">After two friends track her down, she explains that she feels like a failed mother.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="4" para="30">They confide they feel the same way -- but just don't admit it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="31">In communities across America, &quot;mothers were talking about that episode,&quot; says Douglas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="31">&quot;It was like a shock wave, because it was one of the most honest moments on TV about motherhood.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="31">It hit a nerve, making fun of the myth of the perfect mother and the myth of domestic bliss -- that you become a housewife and it's just heaven.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="32">Joan Williams, author of &quot;Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What to Do About It,&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="33">argues that domesticity is the root of the problem.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="33">This gender-based economic system arose about 1780, and still drives the U.S. workplace, which is comprised of two types of workers: the ideal, who works full time and has no time to raise children, and the family caregiver, who is marginalized, cut off from professional and social advancement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="34">&quot;Once the focus shifts away from women's choices to the gender system that sets the frame within which those choices occur, we can see that domesticity's peculiar structuring of market work and family work hurts not only women but also men, children, politics and our emotional life,&quot; she wrote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="35">Williams, an American University law professor, is director of the Program on WorkLife Law, which seeks to eliminate employment discrimination against caregivers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="36">She's optimistic about motherhood and social action.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="37">&quot;Since the 1970s women have accomplished something stunning,&quot; she says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="37">&quot;The U.S. is probably the best country in the world for women who are willing to live the biographies of a male.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="37">But it's probably one of the worst countries in the world for mothers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="38">&quot;So the next frontier is to change the family hostile atmosphere for men as well as women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="38">That will jump-start the stalled revolution.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">I try very, very hard not to think of the conservative movement as a gaggle of thick-skulled fanatics.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="1">To help me along in this process, I seek out well-reasoned commentary from conservative intellectuals such as Tod Lindberg of The Washington Times and Ramesh Ponnuru of the National Review.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="1">But my efforts at ideological toleration inevitably get spoiled when something comes along like Human Events magazine's list of the ``Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">Human Events is a conservative weekly that Ronald Reagan was known to favor, and which the Wall Street Journal called a ``bible of the right.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="2">It compiled its list by polling a panel of conservative academics (such as Robert George of Princeton University) and Washington, D.C., think-tank types (such as Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="2">As such, it offers a fair window into the dementia of contemporary conservative thinking.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">One amusing thing about the list is its seeming inability to distinguish between seminal works of social science and totalitarian manifestos.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="3">Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler and Chairman Mao Tse-tung sit alongside pragmatist philosopher John Dewey and sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="3">You'll be comforted to know that Mao, with 38 points and a No.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="4" para="3">3 ranking, edged out Kinsey, with 37 points.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="5" para="3">``The Feminine Mystique,'' meanwhile, checks in at No.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="6" para="3">7, with 30 points, just behind ``Das Kapital,'' which totaled 31 points.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">Harmful books that got honorable mentions but couldn't crack the top 10 include John Stuart Mill's ``On Liberty,'' Sigmund Freud's ``Introduction to Psychoanalysis'' and Charles Darwin's ``The Descent of Man.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="4">Oh yes, and Lenin's ``What Is to Be Done.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="4">(If you don't see the link among arguing for individual rights, exploring scientific mysteries and constructing a brutally repressive Bolshevik terror state, then clearly you're not thinking like a conservative.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">Interestingly, ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' a czarist forgery that incited countless massacres and inspires anti-Semites around the world to this day, failed to rate a mention.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="5">But ``Unsafe at Any Speed'' and ``Silent Spring,'' which led to such horrors as seat belts and the Clean Water Act, did.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="5">(Given that ``Unsafe at Any Speed'' launched the career of Ralph Nader, who went on to put George W. Bush in the White House, I wonder if conservatives might one day deem it one of the most helpful books of the last two centuries.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">Possibly even more amusing are the explanations for each book's inclusion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="6">They read like 10th-grade book reports from some right-wing, bizarro world high school.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="6">John Maynard Keynes' seminal ``The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'' argued that during recessions governments should cut interest rates, reduce taxes and increase spending, and during expansions do the opposite.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="4" para="6">It makes the list because, Human Events explains, ``FDR adopted the idea as U.S. policy, and the U.S. government now has a $2.6-trillion annual budget and an $8-trillion debt.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="5" para="6">(But didn't Keynesian policies help win World War II and then produce 25 years of phenomenal prosperity?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="6" para="6">And wasn't that debt less than $1 trillion before Reagan took office?)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">The squib on ``The Feminine Mystique'' begins with a fairly anodyne summary of Betty Freidan's pioneering feminist tract.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="7">Rather than explain what's so dangerous about allowing women the choice of having a career, though, Human Events proceeds to quote a review that ``Friedan was from her college days, and until her mid-30s, a Stalinist Marxist.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="7">Not just a Stalinist, but a Marxist to boot!</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">Personally, I fail to see how Friedan's communist past -- she was 42 when she published ``The Feminine Mystique'' -- would discredit her insights about the repressive nature of a world in which women were discriminated against or barred outright from most professions and much of public life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="8">Especially because the conservative movement was itself heavily salted with ex-communists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="8">But then, my mind has already been poisoned by Dewey, Mill and other liberal relativists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">Throughout its lifetime, feminism has spawned its share of catchphrases and epithets.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="1">Simone de Beauvoir gave us &quot;the second sex.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="1">Betty Friedan invented &quot;the feminine mystique.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="1">Arlie Hochschild labeled the daily housework that followed office work &quot;the second shift,&quot; while Rush Limbaugh contributed &quot;feminazis&quot; to the discourse.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">Now another phrase -- choice feminism -- is suddenly gaining currency, while managing to annoy people on the left, right and just about everywhere in between.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">This seemingly innocuous term, coined by a lawyer and scholar, Linda R. Hirshman, in the December issue of The American Prospect, refers to the popular feminist philosophy that in her words declares &quot;a woman could work, stay home, have 10 children or one, marry or stay single.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="3">&quot;It all counted as 'feminist' as long as she chose it,&quot; Hirshman wrote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">The concepts behind choice feminism took over the mainstream in the 1980s, replacing more militant agendas that derided or neglected family life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="4">The idea was that women should decide for themselves how to combine children, career, romance and vacuuming.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="4">What it didn't tell them was how to make the right decision.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="4">Figuring out the balance between home and work turned out to be a lot trickier than anyone thought.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">Hirshman would like to help -- though not in a way many women would welcome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">In her article she denounced choice feminism as a con.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="5">It promised liberation, she said, but actually betrayed women by leaving traditional sex roles intact.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="5">In short, women were still stuck with the housework and child-rearing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="5" para="5">The public sphere, outside the home, she argued, is the only place where women can fully flourish.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="6" para="5">And that, she proclaimed, is where they should be.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">She issued a few simple rules: Marry someone poorer or socially inferior; increase your tolerance of dust.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="6">And, as she puts it: &quot;Have a baby.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="6">Just don't have two.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">On the Web and elsewhere, responses were quick, numerous and fierce.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="7">There were a few supporters, but many more critics.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="7">Conservatives saw her argument as another example of how feminists are intent on destroying the family.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="7">Liberals criticized her for being authoritarian and defining success only by money and status.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="5" para="7">Mothers denounced her for just about everything.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">What is perhaps most surprising, though, is not that feminists like Hirshman believe homemaking is second-class drudgery, but that so many people still get worked up over the issue.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="8">After all, feminist thinkers have been proclaiming the need to free women from the bondage of housework for a long time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="8">It is, as Hirshman freely acknowledges, precisely what Friedan argued in &quot;The Feminine Mystique,&quot; first published more than 40 years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">&quot;The only kind of work which permits an able woman to realize her abilities fully,&quot; Friedan wrote, &quot;is the kind that was forbidden by the feminine mystique, the lifelong commitment to an art or science, to politics or profession.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="9">Not homemaking, not motherhood.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">In an interview, Hirshman said that in the course of researching a book, she began to wonder when feminism switched from offering a clear blueprint for liberation to choosing from Column A and Column B.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">&quot;I was curious to see when we got to the place when they decided to sidestep the definition of the good life by Friedan,&quot; she said, &quot;to whatever floats your boats.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">She traced the change to the late '80s, when the women's movement decided to frame the debate over legalized abortion as a question of a woman's choice.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="12">The language, she says, &quot;spilled over.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">That Hirshman's views on family life now sound so radical is a testament to how roundly the mainstream has rejected them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="13">While rigid doctrines may have made sense in the early days, they don't now, when major goals have been won and a more diverse group of women are in the picture.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="13">Indeed, the common critique of the women's movement in the '60s and '70s was that it was too elitist and dogmatic, that it didn't respect women who wanted to stay home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">Choice feminism was an adjustment to reality.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="14">But reality, of course, is messy and confusing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="14">It's not clear what should give when women are still responsible for a disproportionate share of the housework, they miss their children while they're at work all day, good child care is expensive, and time off or part-time work hampers a career.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="15">In the continuing Web discussion about Hirshman's article, many women angry with her conclusions still agreed with her complaints about the unequal burden between men and women for home and family.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="16">A Web site called the Half Changed World, for example, written by a self-described mom and policy wonk, said: &quot;I honestly don't know what's going to break through the domestic glass ceiling.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="16">I used to think that it just was going to take time, that of course the younger generation would adopt a more equitable distribution of labor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="16">I don't see that happening.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="17">Choice feminism doesn't provide any formula or model for happily balancing family, work, love, chores, play, sleep and more.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="17">Nothing does anymore.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="18">&quot;We've been living through this massive transformation where those predictable pathways have really eroded,&quot; said Kathleen Gerson, a New York University sociologist.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="19">That is why edicts that order women either to get out of the house or to stay there inevitably resurface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="19">Issuing marching orders is simple.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="19">&quot;Viva la revolucion!&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="5" para="19">It's just not helpful.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">Betty Friedan, the visionary, combative feminist who launched a social revolution with her provocative 1963 book, ``The Feminine Mystique,'' died Saturday, which was her 85th birthday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="1">Friedan died of congestive heart failure at her home in Washington, D.C., according to Emily Bazelon, a cousin who was speaking for the family.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="1">She said Friedan had been in failing health for some time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">Her best-selling book identified ``the problem that has no name,'' the unhappiness of post-World War II American women unfulfilled by traditional notions of female domesticity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">Melding sociology and humanistic psychology, the book became the cornerstone of one of the last century's most profound movements, unleashing the first full flowering of American feminism since the 1800s.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">It gave Friedan, an obscure suburban New York housewife and freelance writer, the mantle to meet with popes and heads of state and to lead an international movement that would shake up marriage and the workplace, politics and education.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="5">She founded the National Organization for Women in 1966, making it the first new feminist organization in a half century.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="5">She also was among the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and the group that became the National Abortion Rights Action League.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="6">``I never set out to write a book to change women's lives, to change history,'' said Friedan, who always kept a sense of wonder about her place in history as the mother of the contemporary women's movement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="7">``It's like, `Who, me?'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="7">Yes, me.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="7" para="7">.Maybe my power and glory was that I could speak my truth as a woman and it was the truth of every woman.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="8">Friedan's affinity with mainstream values was the foundation of her authority.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="8">Her emphatic belief that women should have equal rights -- but not at the expense of alienating men -- distinguished her from many feminist leaders who emerged later.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="9">``She found that love between unequals can never succeed,'' Gloria Steinem once said, ``and she has undertaken the immense job of bringing up the status of women so love can succeed.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">Her more moderate brand of feminism, combined with her often irascible nature, led to ruptures with other movement leaders, such as Steinem and the late Bella Abzug.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="10">Some feminists eventually denounced her as a reactionary.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">By the 1980s, feminism had ceased being her primary focus, and she spent her last decades focused on issues of aging, families, work and public policy.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="13">Friedan did not conform to conventional notions of feminine beauty or decorum.She was loud, fast-talking, impatient and abrasive.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="18">In a 1976 book, ``It Changed My Life,'' Friedan said her mother's discontent gave her an early glimpse of the perils of the malaise she would later call the ``feminine mystique.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="19">Friedan did not feel at home until she arrived at Smith College in the late 1930s.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="19">She became editor of the campus newspaper and quickly established a reputation for brilliance.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="19">She finished summa cum laude in psychology in 1942 and entered graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="20">At Berkeley, she won a prestigious science fellowship that had never been given to a psychologist, much less a female.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="20">But she turned the award down when it became apparent that her success threatened a physicist she had been dating.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="20">Although she said she had little, if any, awareness of it at the time, she was fearful of being ``brighter than the boys'' and violating the mystique she would dissect later.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="20">Against the advice of her professors, who included the eminent theorist Erik Erikson, she gave up psychology all together.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="21">Having discovered Marxism in college, Friedan decided that she would work for the ``revolution.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="21">By 1943, she was immersed in popular-front journalism, first at The Federated Press in New York and later at UE News, the official newspaper of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, then one of the nation's most radical unions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="22">In 1947 she married a theatrical producer named Carl Friedman, who later dropped the ``m'' in his last name to create the more distinctive ``Friedan.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="22">In 1948 the Friedans had the first of three children, Daniel.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="22">Four years later when she became pregnant with her second child, Jonathan, and requested maternity leave, she was fired from her job at the union paper, an event she later would call a ``formative experience'' in her evolution as a feminist.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="22">Her third child, Emily, was born in 1956.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="23">Although she was determined to be a happy housewife, she suffered renewed attacks of her childhood asthma and resumed psychotherapy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="23">Urged by her therapist not to waste her education and training, Betty Friedan began to write for women's magazines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="24">She had wanted to write a profile of a woman who had given up a successful career as an advertising executive, married and become a serious sculptor, but editors were doubtful that their housewife-readers would be interested in such a woman.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="24">They accepted the article but only after deleting references to the subject's career.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="24">Within a few years, Friedan said, ``I began to lose my zest (for writing the formulaic articles of women's magazines).''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="25">In 1957, she was asked to conduct a survey of her Smith classmates for their 15th reunion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="25">She found that the women who did not conform exactly to traditional notions of womanhood were happier than those who did.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="25">``Maybe it wasn't education that was the problem, keeping American women from `adjusting to their role as women,' '' she wrote, ``but that narrow definition of `the role of women.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="25">''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="26">She wrote a magazine article based on that argument, but it was repeatedly rejected.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="26">She decided to bypass that venue and put her ideas into a book instead.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="27">She interviewed scores of suburban women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="27">Another part of her research entailed long days in the New York Public Library, looking for shifts in the types of heroines depicted in women's magazine fiction.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="27">The results of her study were stark: Friedan found that the avid career woman who dominated the magazines in the 1930s had given way by the 1950s to a less adventuresome model: the contented homemaker.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="28">Was the 1950s image reality, or was it a self-fulfilling fantasy cooked up by magazine editors and advertisers?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="28">Friedan was staggered by the dissatisfactions aired by wives and mothers, by their vague laments about feeling empty, desperate and incomplete.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="28">A mother of four who had bypassed college for marriage and family told Friedan: ``There's no problem you can even put a name to.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="28">But I'm desperate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="5" para="28">I begin to feel I have no personality.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="29">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="29">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="29">I came to realize,'' Friedan later wrote, ``that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their lives today.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="5" para="29">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="6" para="29">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="7" para="29">.For the startling pattern that began to emerge as one clue led me to another in far-flung fields of modern thought and life, defied not only the conventional image but basic psychological assumptions about women.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="30">She found that books on the psychology of women generally adhered to traditional ideas of women's fulfillment in hearth and home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="30">Seeking a theoretical basis for her views of women's plight, Friedan turned to the work on identity and self realization by psychologists including Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="30">Their ideas informed what became her central tenet: ``that the core of the problem for women today is .</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="30">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="5" para="30">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="6" para="30">a problem of identity -- a stunting or evasion of growth that is perpetuated by the feminine mystique.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="31">Friedan finally produced a 1,000-page manuscript.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="31">It took her five years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="32">Friedan's publisher, W. W. Norton, printed only a few thousand hardcover copies in 1963.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="32">Friedan did not experience the full force of fame until Dell issued the paperback in 1964.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="32">That year, ``The Feminine Mystique'' became the top-selling nonfiction book in the country.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="32">Much of the initial reaction was not favorable.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="5" para="32">Friedan was cursed, told to seek psychiatric help and accused of posing ``more of a threat to the United States than the Russians.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="6" para="32">She was shunned by neighborhood women, her children were kicked out of car pools, and her marriage began to crack under the weight of her growing celebrity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="33">To many black women more concerned with survival than self-fulfillment, Friedan's call to women to find meaningful careers ``seemed to come from another planet,'' according to historian Paula Giddings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="34">The personal narrative that gave ``Feminine Mystique'' much of its power was misleading in another way: It omitted references to Friedan's earlier career as a left-wing journalist, creating the impression that the author had never been anything other than a suburban matron.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="35">Years later, biographer Daniel Horowitz would accuse Friedan of obscuring her past to sell books.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="35">But Friedan insisted she was only being politically savvy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="35">``It was the McCarthy era .</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="35">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="5" para="35">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="6" para="35">and I didn't go around parading my left-wing background because it wouldn't have helped in organizing the women's movement,'' she told the Los Angeles Times a few years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="7" para="35">``On the other hand, I never kept it secret.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="36">``The Feminine Mystique'' was so astute in its analysis that, as futurist Alvin Toffler said, it ``pulled the trigger on history.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="36">The book launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan at the epicenter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="37">In June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on the status of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Four months later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of the nascent National Organization for Women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="38">Among its signature success was lobbying President Lyndon Johnson to sign an Executive Order prohibiting sex discrimination by federal contractors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="39">Today, the group is anchored in Washington, D.C., and has 500,000 members and branches in all 50 states.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="39">But in its early years, NOW's headquarters was Friedan's New York City apartment and Friedan was indisputably in charge.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="40">In 1970, the largest feminist demonstration since the suffrage movement took over Fifth Avenue when Friedan called for a national Women's Strike for Equality.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="40">Held on the 50th anniversary of the passage of the women's suffrage amendment, it drew 500,000 women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="41">But during these heady years, Friedan's marriage was crumbling.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="41">She claimed years later to have been a battered wife, a contention that outraged Carl Friedan, who vociferously denied the charges.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="41">Their 22-year marriage ended in divorce in 1969.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="42">In 1970, Friedan would step down as NOW president amid growing dissatisfaction with her vision of the movement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="42">But not even her critics could deny the power of the changes she had unleashed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="43">By this time the mother of the movement was being assaulted by its more radical elements.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="43">In 1969 she had delivered her first public attack on lesbianism, labeling it a ``lavender menace'' that would tarnish the entire feminist agenda.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="43">Enraged, many lesbians quit NOW.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="44">By the end of the 1970s, Friedan was relegated to the sidelines of the movement she had inspired.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="44">She was dismayed not only by its direction but what she saw as its mounting toll and the growing political backlash.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="44">As she saw it, the movement had burdened rather than liberated women, burning out those who were trying to juggle motherhood and career or penetrate the corporate glass ceiling.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="44">Moreover, she observed, women in lower-level jobs were still earning only 59 cents to every dollar earned by men -- this after almost two decades of renewed feminist activism.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="45">Friedan's response was ``The Second Stage,'' published in 1981.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="45">The movement's senior theorist always had insisted that men were not the enemy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="45">In her new book, startlingly, she suggested that the enemy was the victim herself.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="46">``I believe we have to break through our own feminist mystique,'' Friedan wrote, arguing that, ``The equality we fought for isn't livable, isn't workable, isn't comfortable in the terms that structured our battle.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="46">Feminists, she charged, had fallen into a new trap ``which denied that core of women's personhood that is fulfilled through love, nurture, home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="46">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="46">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="5" para="46">.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="47">Calling the feminist foremother ''hopelessly confused about whose side she's on,`` theorist Ellen Willis wrote that Friedan ''would destroy feminism in order to save it, and beat the Moral Majority by joining it.`` Journalist Susan Faludi, writing in her 1991 book ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,`` said Friedan was ''yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork.``</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="48">Friedan began to turn her focus to other issues.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="48">She received a call from the head of the National Institute on Aging, asking her to become an advocate for older Americans.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="48">She at first fought the idea, ''locked in denial`` about the encroaching reality of her own aging -- she was approaching 60 and hating it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="48">What changed her mind was remembering conversations she'd had with older women while researching ''The Feminine Mystique.`` The healthiest and most vital women she interviewed had been older women -- in their 50s and 60s -- who had careers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="49">In 1993 she published ''The Fountain of Age,`` a book in which she again challenged the prevailing stereotypes and argued that an active, engaged life was the secret to a good old age.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="49">The book earned mixed reviews, with some critics faulting her for presenting an overly optimistic view of the stage of life Friedan herself was experiencing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="50">(End optional trim)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="51">In her last years, Friedan split her time between homes in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and Washington, D.C. She spent more time with her children -- Daniel, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University who won a MacArthur Foundation genius grant; Jonathan, an engineer in Philadelphia; and Emily, a pediatrician in Buffalo, N.Y. -- and their families.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="52">Friedan wrote six books and had teaching posts at many institutions, including Yale, Harvard, the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="52">Surgery in 1997 to replace an infected aortic valve slowed her down only a little.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="52">A few years later, she was a distinguished visiting professor at Cornell University, where she used a $1 million Ford Foundation grant to conduct a three-year study on women, men, work, family and public policy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="53">She continued to deplore the lack of progress on issues that affected the quality of family life, such as flexible scheduling and better and more affordable child care.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="54">Yet she seemed to look back on her life with immense pleasure, saying that the women's movement had succeeded in the United States and other advanced countries beyond her wildest imaginings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="55">''I thought once,`` she said, ''about what should be put on my gravestone: `She helped make women feel better about being women and therefore better able to freely and fully love men.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="55">``</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">Betty Friedan, the writer, thinker and activist who almost single-handedly revived feminism with her 1963 book ``The Feminine Mystique,'' died of congestive heart failure Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">Her insights into what she described as the soul-draining frustrations felt by educated, stay-at-home women in the 1950s, ``the problem that has no name,'' startled a society that expected women to be happy with marriage and children.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="2">Her book became an instant and controversial bestseller, and Friedan became the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">One of the most recognized names and faces of the late 20th century, Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads, maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, legal abortion and many other topics considered radical in the 1960s and 1970s.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="4">Impatient that the federal government, in implementing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, did not appear to be taking equal pay for women seriously enough, she helped found in 1966 the National Organization for Women, the largest and most effective organization in the women's movement, and served as its first president.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="4">She led the 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality in New York in 1970, on the 50th anniversary of women winning the right to vote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus in the 1970s and of the abortion rights organization now known as NARAL-Pro Choice America.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="5">She was an organizer and director of the First Women's Bank and Trust.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">``Many of us think of her as one of the mothers of the modern women's movement,'' said Kim Gandy, NOW president.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="6">``She played a very pivotal, very critical role in launching the second wave of the modern women's movement.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">``She was a giant in the 20th century for women and most significantly was a catalyst for change in the American culture,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="7">``She defined the problem, and then she had the courage to do something about it.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="8">Friedan's was a voice that was loud, insistent and sometimes divisive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="8">She split with NOW in the 1970s after she came to believe that the organization focused too many resources on lesbian issues and that too many feminists hated men.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="8">Her 1981 book ``The Second Stage'' prompted some feminists to denounce her as reactionary.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="9">Her 2000 memoir, ``Life So Far,'' said that her husband, Carl, beat her during their marriage.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="9">He strenuously objected, and Friedan amended the declaration to say that both of them fought physically during their marriage, which ended in divorce in 1969.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="9">He died this December.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="10">She turned to other issues, focusing on ageism, family issues and economic empowerment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="10">``It isn't that I have stopped being a feminist, but women as a special separate interest group are not my concern anymore,'' she said in 1993.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="11">Friedan's cousin, Emily Bazelon, said: ``Her feminism was an aspect of her humanism, and she really cared about the economic well-being of families and of all people,'' Bazelon said Saturday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="12">Bettye Goldstein was born Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill., the Jewish daughter of an immigrant jeweler and a mother who quit her job as an editor of the local newspaper's women's pages to become a homemaker.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="12">She later said she felt like an outsider from childhood.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="12">She skipped second grade and was a high school valedictorian, then moved 1,000 miles east to attend Smith College.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="12">She edited the college newspaper and graduated summa cum laude in 1942.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="13">She did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley but turned down a prestigious fellowship in psychology, afraid of outperforming her then boyfriend.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="13">After the romance broke up, she gave up graduate work and moved to New York's Greenwich Village to work for a labor newspaper.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="13">She married and had a child, but when she became pregnant with a second child, she was fired.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="14">Struggling as a freelance writer, she found that the editors of women's magazines deleted references to her subjects' interests outside the home, telling Friedan that the readers did not want to explore those topics.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="14">She was grinding away on a survey of her Smith College classmates upon their 15-year reunion, when she added a few questions and said she discovered that the highly educated and talented housewives in their mid-30s were dissatisfied and distraught, drugged by tranquilizers, misled by psychoanalysis and ignored by society.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="15">No magazine would publish her article.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="15">Five years later, after significantly more work, she published ``The Feminine Mystique'' as a book and ``pulled the trigger on history,'' as futurist Alvin Toffler said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="15">She pitched it on ``The Jack Paar Show,'' she did question-and-answer interviews in magazines and she took every opportunity to alert the world to the crisis she perceived.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="15">The book eventually sold more than 2 million copies in paperback and remains a staple of college history courses.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="16">Daniel Horowitz, a Smith College professor who wrote ``Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminist Mystique,'' said that although Friedan presented herself at the time as a housewife who had an ``aha!''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="16">moment, her ideas were partly rooted in the humanistic psychology that she studied at Smith.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="17">She shared a Feb. 4 birthday with Rosa Parks, and both Friedan and Coretta Scott King were at the convention of the Progressive Party in Philadelphia in 1948, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="18">``All three of them have their political roots in the struggles for social justice, for African Americans, for women and for working people in the 1940s.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="18">Friedan was deeply embedded in and engaged with issues raised on the left in the labor union movement,'' Horowitz said Saturday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="18">``In 1943, she wrote, 'Men, there's a revolution brewing in the American kitchen.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="18">''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="19">During the next several decades, the highly recognizable Friedan was often seen in demonstrations, protest marches and news conferences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="19">She suffered insults, not just for her ideas, but for her appearance, which she readily admitted was ``not pretty.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="20">``That great head, the hooded eyes, the broad features of a woman the French might describe as une jolie-laide@, which refers to a magnificent kind of ugliness that can be attractive, even beautiful,'' wrote Washington Post reporter Megan Rosenfeld in 1995.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="20">``The head, looking sometimes like a snapping turtle and at others like a lion with a white mane, sits atop a surprisingly short body, out of which comes the voice of a foghorn in heat.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="20">She is always carefully dressed in a New Yorky, nouveau-Bohemian style, with lots of interesting jewelry and spunky little shoes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="20">(She loves to shop, say her friends.)''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="21">Never an organization person, she alienated many who worked with her by insisting on holding the floor, claiming credit and running roughshod over her assistants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="21">She insisted that the women's movement remain in the mainstream of American life, objecting to the ``bra-burning, anti-man, politics-of-orgasm school.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="21">Younger leaders took over NOW, and after the publication of ``The Second Stage,'' authors as different as Susan Brownmiller and Susan Faludi accused her of reversing the revolution.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="22">Friedan declared herself past feminism and went to work on ageism, publishing ``The Fountain of Age'' in 1993.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="22">But she never entirely left the feminist field, showing up at the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston to second a resolution on lesbian rights, teaching at numerous colleges, including the University of Southern California, and serving on the White House Conference on the Family.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="23">She lived in New York City and Washington and had a summer home in Sag Harbor, N.Y. Bazelon said services will be held Monday at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="24">Survivors include three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J., Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia and Emily Friedan of Buffalo, N.Y.; a brother and sister; and nine grandchildren.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="25">``She wanted to change the world, and she did.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="1">Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, &quot;The Feminine Mystique,&quot; ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and in so doing permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="2">The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="3">With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II -- including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="3">Published by W.W. Norton &amp; Co., the book had sold more than 3 million copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into many foreign languages.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="4">For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit, Friedan, with her short stature, round figure, protuberant nose and deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life like a &quot;combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis,&quot; as Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="5">&quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; made Friedan world famous.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="5">It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="6">In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="6">In 1969, she was a founder of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, now known as Naral Pro-Choice America.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="6">With Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug, she founded the Women's Political Caucus in 1971.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="7">Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="8">A brilliant student who had graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942, Friedan had trained as a psychologist but had never pursued a career in the field.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="8">When she wrote &quot;The Feminine Mystique,&quot; she was a suburban housewife and mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles for women's magazines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="9">Though Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, &quot;The Feminine Mystique,&quot; read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more than four decades ago:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="10">&quot;Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came to realize that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to lives their lives today,&quot; Friedan wrote in the opening line of the preface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="10">&quot;I sensed it first as a question mark in my own life, as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily, and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my abilities and education in work that took me away from home.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="11">The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and for the next 400 pages, Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she came to call the feminine mystique.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="12">Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on interviews she conducted with women across the country, Friedan charted the gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent, career-minded New Woman of the 1920s and '30s into the vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="13">(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="14">The portrait she painted was chilling.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="14">For a typical woman of the 1950s, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusively on chores and children.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="14">She cooked and baked and bandaged and chauffeured and laundered and sewed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="14">She did the mopping and the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suit to the cleaners.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="5" para="14">She was happy to keep his dinner warm till he came wearily home from downtown.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="15">The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the media were to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most ardent dream.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="15">Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs could satisfy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="15">Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="15">She consulted a spate doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowling and bridge.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="5" para="15">If those failed, there were always tranquilizers to get her through her day.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="16">A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Friedan interviewed told her:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="17">&quot;A film made of any typical morning in my house would look like an old Marx Brothers comedy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="17">I wash the dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming the newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper down to the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enough clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire year.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="19">&quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; began as a survey Friedan conducted in 1957 for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="19">It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as wives and mothers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="19">Judging from her own capable life, Friedan expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="19">But what she discovered in the women's responses was something far more complex, and more troubling -- a &quot;nameless, aching dissatisfaction&quot; that she would famously call &quot;the problem that has no name.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="20">When Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliff and other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the results were the same.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="20">The women's answers gave her the seeds of her book.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="20">They also forced her to confront the painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="21">Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="21">Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia who parlayed a street-corner collar-button business into a prosperous downtown jewelry store.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="21">Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving up her job for marriage and children.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="21">Only years later, when she was writing &quot;The Feminine Mystique,&quot; did Friedan come to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="22">Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of the time, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="22">She was barred from the fashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely asked on dates.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="22">It was an experience, she would later say, that made her identify with people on the margins of society.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="23">At Smith, she blossomed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="23">For the first time, she could be as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy years she was all those things.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="23">Betty received her bachelor's degree in 1942 -- by that time she had dropped the final &quot;e,&quot; which she considered an affectation of her mother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="24">At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, among others.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="24">She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than the first, that would allow her to continue for doctorate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="24">But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatened by her success.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="24">He pressured her to turn down the fellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recount frequently in interviews.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="5" para="24">She also turned down the physicist, returning home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New York.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="25">There, Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="27">&quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper printers' strike.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="27">The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamut from bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="27">Some critics also felt that Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, &quot;The Second Sex,&quot; dealt with many of the same issues.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="28">Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963, Lucy Freeman called &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; a &quot;highly readable, provocative book,&quot; but went on to question its basic premise, writing, of Friedan:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="29">&quot;Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold a certain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="29">It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens, the women's magazines, as she does.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="29">What is to stop a woman who is interested in national and international affairs from reading magazines that deal with those subjects?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="29">To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves.&quot;'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="30">Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming that Friedan realized she needed more than words to address the condition of women's lives.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="30">After moving back to Manhattan with her family, she was determined to start a progressive organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said, of an NAACP for women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="31">In 1966, Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National Organization for Women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="31">She was its president until 1970.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="35">The First Women's Bank and Trust Co., which she helped found in 1973, is no longer in business.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="35">Nor were even her indomitable presence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="36">Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Friedan was by no means universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- by members of the women's movement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="36">She was famously abrasive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="36">She could be thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of temperament.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="37">In the 1970s and afterward, some feminists criticized Friedan for focusing almost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white women and ignoring those of women of color, lesbians and the poor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="37">Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could, and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="38">In her recent memoir, &quot;Life So Far&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make-up at public events and on television.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="39">Carl Friedan has repeatedly denied the accusations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="39">In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Friedan's account a &quot;complete fabrication.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="43">Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="44">The new society Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="45">&quot;Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,&quot;' she told Life magazine in 1963.</sentence>
