``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone in this life,'' said Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, at a news conference after the arraignment at the Manhattan law offices of Johnny Cochran, who said he would prepare a civil suit on behalf of the Diallo family.
The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe ``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was shot after he had fallen.
