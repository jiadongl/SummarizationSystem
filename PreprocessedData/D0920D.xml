		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">The International Committee of the Red Cross insisted Friday that Britain does not hold any women prisoners in Iraq, although the demand of militants holding a British man hostage is that female prisoners be freed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">The ICRC added that it was ready to act as a mediator to help free Kenneth Bigley.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">The British government said more than 100,000 leaflets had been distributed in Baghdad containing a personal plea from Bigley's family and an appeal to his captors to release him.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">Bigley, an engineer, was kidnapped two weeks ago in Baghdad along with two American colleagues who have since been beheaded.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">The Islamic militants claiming responsibility for Bigley's abduction have demanded the release of female Iraqi prisoners.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="4">The British government has repeatedly stressed that it does not hold any.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">The U.S. military says it has two Iraqi women in custody _ Rihab Rashid Taha, a scientist who became known as &quot;Dr. Germ&quot; for helping Iraq make weapons with anthrax, and Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, a biotech researcher dubbed &quot;Mrs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">Anthrax.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">The ICRC, which visits prisons around the world to monitor the condition and treatment of prisoners, told The Associated Press that it had repeatedly visited Britain's sole detention facility in Iraq, near the southern city of Basra.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">&quot;We have repeatedly visited Shaiba, the only British detention place in Iraq.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="7">There are no women detained there,&quot; said Rana Sidani at the ICRC in Geneva, Switzerland.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">Sidani said the ICRC did not have any contacts with the militant group, controlled by Jordanian terror mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, believed to be holding Bigley.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">&quot;We stand ready if we are contacted to mediate,&quot; she added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday that Britain would not pay a ransom or meet any political demands to secure Bigley's release.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">&quot;If we did not have this position there would be many, many more people who would be kidnapped, and the world would be less safe,&quot; Straw told British Broadcasting Corp. television.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">The Foreign Office said Friday that leaflets had been distributed in the streets around 28 mosques in Baghdad.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">They contained messages from Bigley's family and from prominent British Muslims, including Yusuf Islam, the singer once known as Cat Stevens.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">&quot;I request you, in the name of Allah ... to release the British citizen Ken Bigley for the good name of our religion and according to the sayings of Allah in the Glorious Quran,&quot; said Islam, who was taken off a Washington-bound plane last month and expelled from the United States after his name turned up on a list of people suspected of having terrorist links.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">Britain has complained to the United States about the treatment, and Islam has said he plans legal action against U.S. authorities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">&quot;Our religion Islam does not allow us to harm the innocent,&quot; said the Muslim Council of Britain's Iqbal Sacranie in the leaflet.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="15">&quot;We urge you to please listen to this appeal and release this man back into the arms of his waiting family.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Midway through live analysis of the presidential debate on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on Thursday night, the host, Jon Stewart, called on his &quot;correspondents&quot; in the field for some in-depth analysis.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">&quot;Ed, how are the Kerry people feeling?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">&quot;Ecstatic, Jon,&quot; came the response.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">&quot;Kerry's people couldn't be happier.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="3">Their candidate went up against a sitting war president who's never lost a debate and held his own.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">&quot;OK,&quot; Stewart said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">&quot;And Rob, what's the mood at the Bush camp?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">&quot;Triumph, Jon,&quot; the correspondent said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">&quot;Orgasmic triumph.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="5">Their man faced off against John Kerry, a golden-tongued virtuoso of words and captain of the Yale debate team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="5">He's been honing his oratorical skills since the age of 3, and the way they see it, by not allowing himself to be reduced to tears, the president was the big winner tonight.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">The exchange -- which ended with the Bush campaign &quot;correspondent&quot; pleading &quot;You gotta re-elect him!&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">-- was a clever evisceration both of the shallowness of campaign spin and of the news media's capacity for buying that spin, and ran on Comedy Central the same evening when the campaign spin doctors were earnestly toiling away on other networks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="6">Just to make sure there was no misunderstanding, during a commercial break, Stewart offered a reminder to the guffawing audience in his studio on West 54th Street.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="6">&quot;Remember,&quot; he said gravely.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="6">&quot;We are not actual newspeople.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">Fake news is certainly the comic trope of the moment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">Besides &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; Ali G uses the news talk show format to absurd ends, mocking politicians, celebrities and panels of self-proclaimed experts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="7">The humorist Andy Borowitz files daily stories in perfect news-service deadpan on his Web site, www.BorowitzReport.com.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="7">The phony newspaper The Onion is expanding its print operation to new cities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">And in a strange turnabout, mainstream news outlets have been clamoring to introduce news satire to their programming, never mind that mainstream news is often what is being mocked.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">The ABC news magazine &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; recently began closing the program with a two-minute musical rendition of satirical headlines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="8">Mo Rocca, formerly of &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; played the role of wisecracking on-air correspondent for &quot;Larry King Live&quot; during the political conventions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="8">And Borowitz is a regular on CNN and appears alongside straight-faced legal experts on Court TV.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">&quot;Today I spent an hour on Court TV talking about the Peterson case, and I don't know anything about the Peterson case,&quot; Borowitz said on Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="9">&quot;It's perfectly appropriate on mainstream news shows now to have a satirist in the mix.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">Satirists, perhaps not surprisingly, are loath to talk earnestly about what they do; Stewart is particularly averse to speaking seriously about humor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="10">But when pressed, most say their opening has come because of a polarized electorate that suspects the media of doing the other side's bidding, coupled with high-profile journalistic scandals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">Let down, perhaps, by the mainstream media, 21 percent of people under 30 say they are learning about the campaign from satirical sources like &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and the late-night television monologues, up from 9 percent in 2000, according to a Pew Research Center study released in January.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="11">Comedy Central mocked CNN's motto -- &quot;The most trusted name in news&quot; -- and Walter Cronkite's onetime reputation (as America's most trusted man) on a billboard during the Republican National Convention, which proclaimed &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as &quot;the most trusted name in fake news.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">&quot;This is big because there is this gigantic imbalance and something has got to fill it,&quot; said the cultural critic Neal Gabler, who is obsessed with &quot;The Daily Show.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="12">&quot;Young people get the attitude, the deflationary truth-telling attitude of these shows because they can't find it elsewhere,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">Rocca agreed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="13">&quot;The premise of any joke delivered by oddball newscasters is that they're making fun of the media's treatment of news as much as they are the subjects of the news,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="13">&quot;And if there's one thing that everyone can agree on, it's that, right or wrong, they hate the press.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">Once they have the audience's sympathies, fake news purveyors have a simple task: be funny.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">&quot;A well-told joke that has a Republican target, if it's clever enough, gets Republicans to laugh too,&quot; Rocca said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">News satire of course is a time-tested gag.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="16">Mark Twain wrote fake news stories, and they were a staple of The National Lampoon in the 1970s.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="16">The television era has produced a steady supply of news spoofs like &quot;Not Necessarily the News,&quot; &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; and &quot;Weekend Update&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="16">But even the satirists themselves confess to being surprised by the sudden market for their craft.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">&quot;When I got out of school everyone wanted to write for sitcoms,&quot; Borowitz said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="17">&quot;The idea that you could have a career as a prose satirist.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="17">It's hard to imagine that even five years ago.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="17">The latest evidence of the shift: &quot;America (The Book)&quot; by Stewart and &quot;Daily Show&quot; colleagues, a spoof of a civics textbook, will appear as No.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="17">1 on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list of Oct. 10.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">Of course no self-respecting satirist would take credit for anything so profound as affecting the political discourse, or even to having a political point of view.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="18">Asked about the politics of writers for &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; Ben Karlin, the executive producer, insisted, &quot;We have no agenda other than holding on to our cushy, high-paying, basic cable jobs.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">As for the Pew study crediting shows like his for teaching a fifth of young Americans about politics, Karlin said he was dubious.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="19">For one thing, he said, the audience could not possibly get the jokes if it did not already know the news stories that were being spoofed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="19">&quot;People are getting their news from the tops of taxi cabs, from sluglines on Yahoo and from accidentally stopping on CNN,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">The hyped-up news cycle has been a boon to the fake news racket.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="20">For one thing, there is a steady flow of new material.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="20">And for another, a more informed public means a bigger potential audience.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="20">When Cat Stevens was barred from entering the country late last month after showing up on a terrorist watch list, Borowitz said he sat down to write a fake news story about it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="20">&quot;You don't have to start by saying to the audience, 'See, there was this singer-songwriter from the '70s named Cat Stevens,&quot;' he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="6" para="20">&quot;In comedy parlance that was called the set-up.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="7" para="20">Now you can go straight to the punch line.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="8" para="20">(Borowitz came up with &quot;Angry Cat Stevens Vows to Resume Singing: Broadcasts Threat on Al-Jazeera.&quot;)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">On its most basic level, news satire derives its humor from the juxtaposition of earnest newspeak and the absurd.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="21">&quot;Nothing is more serious and pompous than a network news anchor or the earnest prose style of a newspaper,&quot; Borowitz said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="21">&quot;The parody of the style becomes a joke in and of itself.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="22">The form of news satire on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; is more sophisticated, mocking not just the style of the news but the conventions of journalism; for example, the mainstream news media's fixation with fairness.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="23">&quot;There's some weird handcuffs on the mainstream news so that they feel that no matter what, they have to present both sides of the argument, even if one side of an argument is wrong,&quot; Karlin said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="23">&quot;The idea that we give the guilty an equal opportunity to defend themselves -- we have no idea why.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="24">On one fake newscast, Stewart asked a correspondent in the field for his opinion on the Swift Boat veterans claims against Sen. John Kerry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="24">&quot;My opinion?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="24">the reporter responded.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="24">&quot;I don't have opinions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="24">I'm a reporter, Jon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="6" para="24">My job is to spend half the time repeating what one side says, and half the time repeating the other.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="7" para="24">Little thing called objectivity; might want to look it up.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="25">(STORY CAN END HERE.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="25">OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="26">Although he is coy about his politics, Stewart seems to relish mocking conservatives more than liberals, and at his studio on Thursday night, the crowd of people in their 20s, divided almost evenly between men and women, made no secret of their distaste for President Bush while watching the debate on monitors before the show began.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="27">On Friday, Michael Hoyt, the executive editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, said that in some ways Stewart was providing a counterbalance to the conservatism of the Fox News Channel.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="28">&quot;People are hungry for some sort of attitude and guidance through an ocean of spin,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="28">&quot;Fox supplies it in one way, and Jon Stewart in another.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="28">Both are reactions to distorted objectivity, what I call a phony objectivity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="28">They are pieces of the same puzzle.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="29">Gabler said, &quot;It's a form of humor that subverts media convention and reveals the pomposities and idiocies of politicians, but even more the pomposities and idiocies of the media that covers the politicians.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="30">All of which begs the question: What are programs like &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; hoping to accomplish by bringing news satirists on board?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="30">Rocca's antics on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; during the conventions this summer, while occasionally funny, only highlighted the staid nature of the broadcast, and for his part, King seemed not to know how to react, other than to laugh a bit too zealously at Rocca's wisecracks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="31">Shelley Ross, the producer of &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; who came up with the idea to do the musical news satire gag on her program, inspired by &quot;That was the Week That Was&quot; in the 1960s, said she felt satire was a proper response to searching times.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="31">&quot;It represents a healthy society,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="32">For his part Rocca said he considered his satirical bits a kind of public service.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="32">&quot;Television newscasts are so calcified and rigid, any departure from that is exhilarating,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="32">&quot;And five minutes of good satire is a lot more useful than an hour on J.Lo's baby shower.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">Puzzled and angry at being barred from the United States, Yusuf Islam, the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, returned to London vowing to find out why.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">Surrounded by a throng of reporters at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, Islam said it was ludicrous that he's on Washington's no-fly list, suspected of ties to terrorists, and said he would challenge the decision to block him from entering the country.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">&quot;Half of me wants to smile, and half of me wants to growl.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="3">The whole thing is totally ridiculous,&quot; said Islam, who had a string of hits in the 1960s and '70s, but abandoned his music career after converting to Islam.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">&quot;Everybody knows who I am.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="4">I am no secret figure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="4">Everybody knows my campaigning for charity, for peace.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="4" para="4">There's got to be a whole lot of explanation.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">Islam's United Airlines flight to Dulles International Airport was diverted to Maine's Bangor International Airport when U.S. officials reviewing the passenger list discovered he was aboard.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">According to his Web site, the singer was last in the United States two months ago with his record company.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="6">During a visit in May he met with officials of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives &quot;to talk about philanthropic work,&quot; according to White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">U.S. authorities provided few details about Islam's alleged connection to terrorism or when he was added to the watch list.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">Homeland Security spokesman Brian Doyle would only say that the intelligence community has recently obtained information that &quot;further heightens concern&quot; about Islam.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">&quot;Yusuf Islam has been placed on the watch lists because of activities that could potentially be related to terrorism,&quot; Doyle said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="9">&quot;It's a serious matter.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">A second government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. authorities think donations from Islam may have ended up helping to fund blind sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted for a plot to bomb New York City landmarks, and Hamas, a Palestinian militant group considered a terrorist organization by the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw complained Wednesday to U.S. officials about their treatment of Islam, telling U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell &quot;that this action should not have been taken,&quot; the Foreign Office said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="11">It was not clear whether Straw meant Islam's detention, or his inclusion on the watch list.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">Islam, who was traveling with his 21-year-old daughter, Maymanah, told reporters in London he was treated well by FBI agents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="12">He said he was bound for Nashville to &quot;initiate some recordings.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="13">Islam said he had been well treated by U.S. officials.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="13">&quot;The one positive thing I can say is that a lot of security officers are pleased because they got my autograph,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="14">&quot;People make mistakes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="14">I just hope they made a big mistake.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="14">We'll see,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="15">A statement on Islam's Web site said he was seeking further information from U.S. authorities &quot;so that we can challenge the decision to refuse him entry.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">Cat Stevens, who abandoned his music career when he converted to Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam 30 years ago, is making a surprise comeback with a single that could top the charts at Christmas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Yusuf Islam, 56, who sold 50 million records in the 1960s and 1970s, has recorded a version of his 1970 hit &quot;Father and Son&quot; with Ronan Keating, the Irish former boy-band star, The Times newspaper reported Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">The bookmaker William Hill tipped the song Wednesday as the 7-1 favorite to become the Christmas No 1, it added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">As Cat Stevens, Islam enjoyed a string of hits including &quot;Wild World&quot; and &quot;Moonshadow.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="4">He converted to Islam after nearly drowning in California in 1976.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">He avoided recording secular music, believing mistakenly, he now admits, that it was forbidden by the Koran.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">He devoted himself to creating single-faith Islamic schools in Britain but denies delivering funds to the Islamic militant group Hamas in Israel.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">Islam has known Keating, a former member of Boyzone, for a decade.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">A spokesman for Keating told The Times: &quot;They first met ten years ago when Boyzone performed 'Father and Son' on 'Top Of The Pops' (on BBC television) and stayed in touch.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="8">Ronan asked him to do the duet and he said yes.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">Islams recent journey to Nashville, curtailed by the US authorities, was to discuss plans for a new album.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">He is writing a Broadway musical based on his hits and sang at a charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, his first live appearance in 25 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">Islam has denied supporting terrorist organisations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">Islam was deported from the United States last month after being denied entry on &quot;security grounds&quot; and was released without charge.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="1">Don't mistake introspection for depression.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">&quot;It's not only a label we didn't want, it's untrue,&quot; Joe Loeffler, bassist and vocalist, said by phone recently.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="3">&quot;It's kind of frustrating, because we deal with it so much.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">&quot;With us, really, there's no label you can apply; it's so difficult to.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">And there's no need to, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">Just as well.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="6">Ask Loeffler and his bandmates/siblings Sam and Pete to list the music that influenced the band's sound, and they'll list Helmet, Tool, Sinead O'Connor and Yusuf Islam -- the artist once known as Cat Stevens and most recently in the news as being on the United State's no-fly list for alleged ties to terrorism, an accusation the artist vehemently denies.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">&quot;My favorite artist, probably because of her stability, in doing what she tries to do record after record, is Enya,&quot; said Joe Loeffler, 24.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">And what links such an eclectic mix to Chevelle?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">&quot;It's pretty cheesy, but the thread is, it's good music,&quot; Loeffler said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">That, and passion.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">The singer once known as Cat Stevens, now a peace activist whose name was on a U.S. list of people suspected of having terrorist links, will receive a peace prize from a foundation headed by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, organizers said Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">The singer, now named Yusuf Islam, is expected to attend the ceremony on Rome's Capitoline Hill on Wednesday, said Enzo Cursio, a spokesman for the Gorbachev Foundation.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">The government ordered U.S. airlines Friday to turn over personal information about passengers so it can test a system for identifying potential terrorists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="1">The move was expected but nonetheless brought protests from civil libertarians worried about invasions of privacy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">Under the system, called &quot;Secure Flight,&quot; the Transportation Security Administration will compare passenger data with names on two government watch lists: a &quot;no-fly&quot; list comprises known or suspected terrorists, and a &quot;watch&quot; list names people who should face tighter scrutiny before boarding planes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">&quot;Secure Flight represents a significant step in securing domestic air travel and safeguarding national security information, namely, the watchlists,&quot; the TSA said in a notice announcing the order.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">The TSA order gives 72 airlines until Nov. 23 to turn over computerized data for passengers who traveled on domestic flights during June.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">The TSA says Secure Flight differs from the previous plan because it does not compare personal data with commercial databases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="10">The agency said, however, it will test the passenger information &quot;on a very limited basis&quot; against commercial data.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">Under the current system, the government shares parts of the watchlists with airlines, which are responsible for making sure suspected terrorists don't get on planes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="11">But the airlines don't have access to everyone who's considered a threat to aviation because some of the names of known or suspected terrorists are classified.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="13">Under Secure Flight, the government would take responsibility for checking passengers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="13">That was among recommendations of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="14">An airline industry representative said the carriers support the government's goals but remain wary of privacy concerns.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="15">&quot;U.S. airlines have long-standing concerns that center on privacy and operational issues,&quot; said James May, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents major airlines.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="16">In issuing the order, the TSA didn't resolve another key concern for privacy advocates: redress.</sentence>
