Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this weekcutting Norway's total oil output by 200,000 barrels per day.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this weekalmost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans.
