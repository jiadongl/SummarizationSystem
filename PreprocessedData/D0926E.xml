		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">The Kansas City Star SALINA, Kan. -- Anytime Jeff Palmer hears a plane overhead, he peers out the front window of Mr. G's Market.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">&quot;I look to see if it's the GlobalFlyer,&quot; says Palmer, who from behind the store counter demonstrates how he bends down and tilts his head toward the sky.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">For more than two weeks the store cashier has been peering out this window, hoping to get a glimpse of the cutting-edge plane designed to break yet another aviation record for millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">Having already shattered records in a hot-air balloon and a glider, Fossett hopes to soon become the first to make a solo, nonstop flight around the world without refueling.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">As early as next Sunday, the first window of opportunity, Palmer should get a pretty good look at the plane as Fossett and the Virgin Atlantic team attempt the feat from the Salina airport, less than a mile from Mr. G's.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">The team was attracted to the central Kansas town and its airport for the extra-long runway and newly renovated hangar 703.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">It's inside hangar 703 where the GlobalFlyer, with its 114-feet wing span and 13 gas tanks, has been housed and worked on since it arrived from Mojave, Calif., on Jan. 6.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">While the team waits for good weather around the world, constantly measuring barometric pressures and monitoring jet streams, residents are preparing for what they say is their town's best bet to get into the history books.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">Employees at the Holiday Inn are ready to roll out their red carpet -- literally -- for the hordes of international and national reporters and television crews.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="11">The hotel bar is concocting a special GlobalFlyer drink, with ingredients not yet revealed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">&quot;It'll be like the flight,&quot; says smiling Holiday Inn sales manager Gala Bloyd, referring to how the details of the mission are kept under wraps until closer to the departure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">&quot;We'll announce that (the ingredients) when they take off.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">The welcome parties are planned for people like Virgin Atlantic's chairman, Sir Richard Branson, and town leaders have scheduled tours to introduce Salina to an international audience.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="13">Hundreds of volunteers are lined up to make sure guests are treated right.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">&quot;This gives us the opportunity to introduce our visitors here to what this community is all about,&quot; says Gerald Cook, president of the Salina Area Chamber of Commerce, who has already fielded questions from reporters in New York, London and Italy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="14">&quot;It's a show and tell, if you will.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">But before all that, and before Fossett hits the sky for what could be up to an 80-hour flight, some preparations remain.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="15">For Fossett, the crews from Virgin Atlantic and Scaled Composites (which designed and built the plane) and the Kansas State University Airway Science students who've become an integral part of the mission, there's a lot of unfinished business.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">When officials with Virgin Atlantic came to look at the Salina airport facilities and runway, which measures 12,300 feet long, they visited Salina's K-State campus.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="16">The location's main focus is its College of Technology and Aviation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="17">By that time Salina officials knew there was a good probability the town would be the location for the launch and the landing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="17">But they had no idea where the flight would be controlled from, or in more technical terms, where Mission Control would be.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">&quot;It could have been in London, Hong Kong, anywhere,&quot; says Tim Rogers, executive director of the Salina Airport Authority.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="18">But &quot;when they saw the campus facility, immediately the light came on for Virgin Atlantic staffers, 'This is ideal for Mission Control.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="18">&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Shortly after the announcement was made that the entire mission would take place in Salina, school officials got in touch with several Airway Science students -- aspiring professional pilots and airplane mechanics.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="19">From there, 12 students were hand-picked to help on the mission.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">They thought they would run a few errands, do minor research and, if they were lucky, pick up valuable knowledge from seasoned aviation professionals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">Monica Chester, a senior from Phillipsburg in the professional pilot program, laughs now as she and three other students describe how they are instead helping map the mission's flight plan by researching weather patterns and jet streams.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="22">And the eight aviation mechanics students are helping improve and repair the plane to ensure a successful mission.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="23">&quot;It's definitely not a stand-back-and-see-how-it's-done kind of job,&quot; Chester says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="23">&quot;It's step up and get it done.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="24">Under the supervision of Philip Grassa, the crew chief from Scaled Composites, the aviation mechanics students work nearly every day on the plane.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="24">After a test flight, the students helped repair a valve that was causing trouble with cabin pressure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="25">Earlier last week the students installed the flight tires on the plane.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="25">The tires were new, but the tread was shaved down to save on weight.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="26">&quot;They didn't think they'd get to work on the airplane as an actual mechanic,&quot; says Grassa, who has worked on GlobalFlyer for two years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="26">&quot;They thought they'd be running errands for me.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="27">Grassa hollers, &quot;How we doing over there?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="27">to a small group working on a shield to go over the flight controls in the back of the cabin.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="28">After offering a suggestion of where to put glue, Grassa was back to talking about the students and how they have been integral in helping get GlobalFlyer ready.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="29">&quot;This is basically my adopted crew for the preparation for this mission,&quot; Grassa says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="30">Some of the students get wide eyes as they talk about working with Scaled Composites employees and with Fossett -- whom senior Seth Short from Burrton describes as &quot;your grandpa in real good physical shape.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="30">He's as nice as can be.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="31">As Chester puts it: &quot;We hoped we'd get to meet him, but now we're on a first-name basis with him.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="32">For the students in the professional pilot program, their work is in front of the computer calculating fluctuations in the weather.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="32">They balance the benefits of flying at high altitudes where the jet engine is more efficient versus lower where a plane gets the best winds.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="33">Short explains how the weather needs to be just right.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="34">&quot;We're looking for cold weather, high barometric pressure and favorable jet stream,&quot; says Short.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="34">&quot;He can't take off in any precipitation that would freeze.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="35">Another pilot student, Nancy Milleret of Tonganoxie, jumps in to interpret.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="36">&quot;You don't want ice on the plane,&quot; says the junior who is used to breaking down aviation talk to the students she guides in the air.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="36">&quot;Ice is bad.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="37">That's because the plane is not equipped with de-icing gear.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="37">That would add weight to the plane.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="37">And for a trip around the world without refueling, extra weight is also bad.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="38">Student Pat Rinearson of Olathe explains why the plane needs the favorable jet stream.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="39">&quot;He wants the tail winds,&quot; Rinearson says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="39">&quot;The jet stream moves every minute.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="39">What we're trying to do is figure out where it is and average what the tail wind component will be through the flight.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="40">The plane will travel east to west.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="40">It doesn't have enough gas to make the 20,000-nautical-mile trip without the benefit of tail winds.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="40">As Milleret explains: &quot;West to east, he wouldn't make it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="40">He'd be going against the wind.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="41">Whatever the students come up with in their research and calculations, they often show to Fossett.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="42">&quot;What we put into the computer, Steve looks at that,&quot; Short says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="42">&quot;When we come up with a flight plan, we show it to Steve and he says, 'Explain it to me.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="42">&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="43">As the students work, the town and nearby residents wait.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="44">The No.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="44">1 question airport director Rogers gets: &quot;Can we see the airplane?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="45">Looks like Palmer isn't the only one disappointed that there has been no general public viewing of the plane.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="46">&quot;It's the question everyone has,&quot; says Rogers, who has watched the airport's Web site go from 500 hits a day to 20,000 because of interest in GlobalFlyer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="47">Rogers says that &quot;time is the most critical part of the process&quot; and taking time out to show the airplane would hurt the preparation phase.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="48">&quot;Once I've had the opportunity to explain that, individuals seem to understand,&quot; Rogers says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="49">On the day of departure and landing, the airport can accommodate as many as 30,000 spectators.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="49">Two areas have been set up, one on the north side and one at the south, for people to watch.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="50">Some still think the residents deserve a special viewing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="51">&quot;You'd think they should just fly over the town someday,&quot; says Dustin Forsberg, 23, as he sat outside Cozy Inn Hamburgers with his brother Derek and a friend.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="51">&quot;Just as a 'Thanks for letting us be here.'</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="51">&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="52">Others say that while having the flight take off and land in Salina is exciting, it's what the mission does for the town that beats all.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="53">Cook, the chamber president, estimates the town has already benefited from &quot;millions of dollars&quot; in advertising -- and the plane still sits in hangar 703.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="54">&quot;It's going to put Salina on the map,&quot; says aviation student Samuel Butler, originally from Cleveland, as he stands outside the town's municipal airport.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="54">&quot;That's what I like about it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="54">...</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="54">It's history.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="55">To reach Laura Bauer, send e-mail to lbauerkcstar.com.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Steve Fossett is waiting on the wind.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">With all preparations complete for a solo, non-stop flight  around the globe, the only thing standing in the way of the  legendary adventurers next attempt to set a world record is an  uncooperative jet stream.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">&quot;It's never been an exact science,&quot; said spokeswoman Anna  Burdsall.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">&quot;There are two different weather systems we're dealing  with -- the ground weather in Salinas, that's one consideration, and  the other is the weather and the jet stream going around the  world.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">The launch of the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer has been delayed a  number of times since it arrived in Salinas, Kansas, on January 7.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">The light-bodied aircraft relies on prevailing winds, or the jet  stream, to help push it along its journey.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">But it needs to avoid the  jet stream until it reaches its cruising altitude or else it could  be damaged by heavy turbulence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">A February 2 launch was cancelled because the jet stream moved  too far north, which meant Fossett would lose too much fuel catching  up to it to make it the rest of the way around the world.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">The February 6 and February 8 launches were cancelled because  the jet stream moved too close to Kansas and created a situation of  heavy wind and turbulence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">So Fossett and his crew have remained on high alert, waiting for  the perfect weather conditions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">The next potential launch date is  late next week.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">&quot;Everyone within the project team understands how these type of  projects work,&quot; said Burdsall, who described the mood of the 30-plus  people working on the project as one of anticipation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">The project brings together three giants of aviation and  adventure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with  jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="11">The  American millionaire became famous in the mid 1990s when he made a  number of attempts with British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson to  fly around the globe in a hot air balloon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">Branson, whose company Virgin Atlantic Airways is funding the  GlobalFlyer, is acting as the reserve pilot.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">The British businessman has also set a number of sailing and  aviation records in his own right while promoting the Virgin brand.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="13">He will monitor Fossett's progress from mission control in Salinas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">The GlobalFlyer was designed by Burt Rutan, who recently made  headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10-million-dollar &quot;X Prize&quot;  for sending a privately-designed craft into space twice in two  weeks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother  Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days  for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80  hours, and by doing it on his own.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">&quot;The first solo non-stop is a grand endeavour,&quot; Fossett said in  an interview on the GlobalFlyer Web site.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">&quot;This will require all of my abilities as a pilot, it will test  my endurance, and it will demonstrate the finest in lightweight  aircraft construction and improvements in jet engine fuel efficiency  that have never before been achieved.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">The 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine aircraft will  carry nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for  the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">Some of the major cities Fossett expects to pass along the way  are Chicago, Toronto, London, Paris, Rome, Cairo, Bahrain, Karachi,  Calcutta, Shanghai, Tokyo, Honolulu and Los Angeles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">Virgin is looking for people with high powered telescopes to  operate as spotters and take pictures and video of the plane as it  flies overhead at 45,000 feet (13,636 meters).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">Facts and figures about the Virgin  Atlantic GlobalFlyer, which is scheduled to take off from Salina,  Kansas, on Monday with American Steve Fossett at the controls:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">The goal:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">- a solo, non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">One hundred one years after the Wright brothers ushered in the age of powered flight, Steve Fossett is ready to tackle what may be the last great challenge in world aviation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="1">From Kansas, not Kitty Hawk.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Weather permitting, the 60-year-old millionaire will take off from the Salina, Kan., municipal airport today and be back three days later, by way of Montreal; London; Paris; Rome; Cairo, Egypt; Bahrain; Karachi, Pakistan; Calcutta, India; Shanghai; Tokyo; Honolulu; and Los Angeles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">There will be no stops.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="3">No refueling.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="3">And not much sleep for Fossett, who will be wedged in the 7 foot cockpit of a veritable flying fuel tank as he attempts the first solo flight around the world on one tank of gas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">If he's successful, Fossett will earn a place in history alongside aviator Wiley Post, who circled the globe alone in 1933 in a single-engine airplane, the Winnie Mae.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="4">Post made 11 stops and took just under eight8 days.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">&quot;Flying around the world has always been a great adventure,&quot; Fossett says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">&quot;I hope to make it with no stops and in under 80 hours.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">It won't be his first around-the-world flight.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="6">In 2002, he became the first person to solo the globe in a balloon -- a 14-day odyssey, which began and ended in Australia.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="6">It was his sixth attempt.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">The solo aspect of the record is important to Fossett.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">&quot;Ninety-one people flew across the Atlantic before (Charles) LIndbergh did,&quot; he says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="8">&quot;The hallmarks of aviation are that solo flights are ranked higher than crew flights just because of the difficulty and the level of self-reliance required.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">He may be flying solo, but he will be supported by more than 40 engineers, meteorologists and pilots at Salina &quot;mission control&quot; who will advise him by radio as he circles the globe.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="9">A network of amateur spotters will report &quot;Fossett sightings&quot; as he travels.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="9">And a chase plane will rendezvous with him several times during the three-day flight.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">Fossett, who made his fortune as a trader on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, is the most visible of three aviation giants who have pooled their talents for the record attempt.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">Virgin Atlantic Airways founder and chairman Richard Branson, himself an avid balloonist, is funding the $2.5 million project, which he calls &quot;the last great aviation record inside the Earth's atmosphere and the first great aviation achievement of this century.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">Branson, whose $2.2 billion net worth makes him No.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="12">247 on Forbes' list of the world's richest people, isn't fretting about the cost.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="12">Besides, he says the flight will demonstrate technology that will help develop &quot;a new generation of more fuel-efficient commercial aircraft.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">The airplane is decked out in the red-and-white livery of Branson's airline, but the craft is the brainchild of aviation design genius Burt Rutan, whose SpaceShipOne last year became the first privately built craft to reach the edge of space.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="13">Rutan won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for the advancement of space tourism.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">The Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer -- first sketched by Rutan on the back of a napkin in 1999 -- is undoubtedly one of the strangest-looking flying machines ever to take wing over the Kansas heartland.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">Built by Rutan's Scaled Composites of Mojave, Calif., it consists of two 44-foot lightweight carbon fiber torpedoes joined at the hip.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="17">Fully loaded, the plane carries 3,000 gallons of jet fuel, six times its own weight.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="17">Commercial airliners carry less than half their weight in fuel.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">At takeoff, because so much fuel is stored in the plane's hollow wings, they will droop to within 3 feet of the runway -- meaning any sudden gust of wind could become an adventure-ending disaster.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="19">If I miscalculate, I will run right into the cornfields.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="20">The dicey aspects of the takeoff are one reason Fossett chose the Salina airport.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="20">Its 12,300-foot runway and a 1,300-foot overrun -- built when it was Schilling Air Force Base -- provide plenty of room for the Global Flyer to get up to takeoff speed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="21">Once he is airborne, Fossett intends to climb to around 50,000 feet, well above the altitude flown by commercial traffic.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="21">The plane will be so heavy early in the flights that he'll have to avoid the turbulence of the jet stream.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="22">As the plane's fuel load lightens, however, the jet stream will play a major role in whether Fossett will make it home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="22">As he crosses Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Ocean, he hopes to use the tailwind to add an average of 70 miles to his ground speed and increase his range.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="23">The Global Flyer carries only enough fuel to cover 20,000 miles in still air -- a good 3,000 miles short of the 36,787.559-kilometer minimum distance required for the arbiter of world aviation records, the Paris-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, to recognize the feat.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="26">So critical is the jet stream to Fossett's ambitions -- both as an early obstacle and a late-in-the-game friend -- that the flight has already been delayed more than two weeks in hopes of a more favorable alignment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="27">Although the plane has been ready to fly since Feb. 2, the weather has prompted several delays.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="27">A meteorological &quot;go&quot; requires the proper speed and course of winds aloft, the right local weather (cold and calm) for the absence of any major storms along Fossett's planned route.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="30">It also had two engines and a speed that averaged a little over 100 miles an hour.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="30">Because it couldn't fly high enough to make use of the jet stream, the flight took nine days -- and nearly failed when it had to be rerouted due to Libya's refusal to let the plane enter its airspace.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="31">Unlike his marathon balloon flights, which have allowed time for napping, Fossett -- cruising at nearly 300 miles an hour -- will have to stay awake for most, if not all, of the 80 hours he is airborne.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="32">But as a precaution, the plane also carries a control system that would maintain the course in the event Fossett nods off.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="33">Fossett hasn't said publicly what he'll do if he doesn't make it, but his earlier balloon flights have made it clear that he doesn't quit easily.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="34">His successful around-the-world flight in 2002 was his sixth attempt in eight years -- including one flight that ended in a near disaster when a thunderstorm shredded his balloon and he had to ditch off the coast of Australia.</sentence>
