Sri Lanka's top Tamil Tiger rebel group on Friday began a week-long meeting in Switzerland which is meant to prepare for the next round of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government, the Swiss foreign ministry said.
A total of 10 Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels were released on bail on Thursday in the eastern Batticaloa district, the pro-rebel Tamilnet said.
