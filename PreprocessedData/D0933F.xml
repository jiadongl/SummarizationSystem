		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia when they grow older, according to research published on Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Doctors in Sweden and Britain spotted the statistical risk after sifting through the medical records of 712,000 people born in Sweden between 1973 and 1980.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">They identified 639 people who had been hospitalised with schizophrenia at some point between 1989 and 2001.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="3">Only four of these were siblings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">After taking into account the patients' socioeconomic background, family history of psychosis, early parental death and other factors that could affect the outcome, the researchers found a strong statistical link between schizophrenics and the age of their father.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">More than 15 percent of cases may have been due to the fact that the patient had a father who was aged over 30 years at birth, they believe.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">The risk of schizophrenia was statistically small but rose steadily the greater the age of the father at birth.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">The authors say this statistical evidence adds to previous research that points to an inherited source for schizophrenia and that mutations in sperm, which accumulate as a man gets older, contribute to the risk.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">Schizophrenia is a severe disease of the brain, characterised by hallucinations and delusions that give a distorted view of reality.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">It is not, as is popularly thought, a Jekyll-and-Hyde condition of split personality.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">The study is published by BMJ Online First, of the British Medical Journal (BMJ).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">Its lead author is Finn Rasmussen, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">The doctors say that their findings are important, given the trend in developed countries towards delaying parenthood.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">In the case of England and Wales, they note that the average age of fathers at the birth of their child was 29.2 years in 1980.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="11">In 2002, this had risen to 32.1 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">If the model is correct, this increase in paternal age could have led to an additional 720 cases of schizophrenia in 2002.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Researchers in Iceland have discovered a region in the human genome that, among Europeans, appears to promote fertility, and maybe longevity as well.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">Though the region, a stretch of DNA on the 17th chromosome, occurs in people of all countries, it is much more common in Europeans, as if its effect is set off by something in the European environment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="2">A further unusual property is that the genetic region has a much more ancient lineage than most human genes, and the researchers suggest, as one possible explanation, that it could have entered the human genome through interbreeding with one of the archaic human lineages that developed in parallel with that of modern humans.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">The genetic region was discovered by scientists at DeCode Genetics, a biotechnology company in Reykjavik, Iceland, which has made the Icelandic population, with its comprehensive genealogy and medical records, a prime hunting ground for the genetic roots of common diseases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">Their finding is published in Monday's issue of Nature Genetics in a report by Kari Stefansson, Augustine Kong, Hreinn Stefansson and other DeCode scientists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">The report seems likely to receive considerable attention, even though it raises as many questions as it answers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">&quot;I thought it was one of the most interesting papers in population genetics I have ever read,&quot; said Nick Patterson, a mathematician at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who advised DeCode on the article but has no other connection with the company.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">The DNA region came to light during the search for a schizophrenia-causing gene, which turned out not to be there.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">But the DeCode researchers noticed that the DNA sequences they had examined did not seem to agree with those in the standard human genome sequence, said Kari Stefansson, DeCode's chief executive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">The lack of agreement turned out to be caused by the fact that the region exists in two forms in the Icelandic population.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">The region is not a single gene but a vast section of DNA, some 900,000 units in length, situated in the 17th of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="6">In some Icelanders, the DeCode team found, the section runs in the standard direction, but in others it is flipped.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="6">Looking for any physical consequence, the DeCode researchers found that women carrying the inverted section tended to have slightly more children.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">The section carries several known genes, not one of which has any obvious connection with fertility.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">It is not clear why inverting the section should have any effect on the number of children, Stefansson said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="7">But the inversion does increase the rate of recombination, the shuffling of genes between generations that is a major source of genetic novelty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="7">That could account for some of the increase in fertility.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">The DeCode scientists found that the chromosome-17 inversion is rare in Africans and almost absent in Asians, but is present in 20 percent of Europeans, the same frequency as in Iceland.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">The inversion seems to have been favored by natural selection among Europeans in fairly recent times, perhaps the past 10,000 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="8">&quot;Maybe something switched it on in the European environment, such as an interaction with diet,&quot; said David Reich, a population geneticist at the Broad Institute.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">Fertility is without doubt affected by different genes in different populations, and DeCode found a genetic element special to Europeans because that is where it was looking.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="10">The increased frequency of the inversion in Europeans is one of a growing number of examples of recent human evolution.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">The inversion itself, however, is surprisingly ancient.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="11">Its age is revealed by its counterpart, the standard or noninverted section of chromosome 17.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="11">The standard and inverted regions cannot exchange genetic elements during recombination because their DNA sequences do not match.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="11">Hence, unlike most of the rest of the genome, which gets shuffled in each generation, the two forms have existed separately since their creation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="11">This event presumably happened when the region came adrift from its parent chromosome and got knitted back in the opposite way.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">When all the known versions of a human gene are compared, in most cases they turn out to have had a single common ancestor about a million years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="12">But the standard and flipped versions of the chromosome 17 region last shared a common ancestor 3 million years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="12">It is highly unusual for two versions of a gene to endure for so long, because one will usually get lost by a natural process of elimination.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">The DeCode researchers propose two explanations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="13">One is that the standard and flipped versions confer different advantages, so that it is beneficial for a person to have inherited a copy of each from different parents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="13">This balancing selection can keep two versions of a gene around in a population indefinitely.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">DeCode's alternative proposal is that the flipped version was carried for many years in a different human lineage, one of the archaic populations that preceded the emergence of anatomically modern humans in Africa 150,000 years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="14">Then, in some episode of interbreeding, a single copy of the flipped version entered the modern human lineage some time before humans left Africa 60,000 years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">In support of this view, the flipped version carries far fewer mutations than does the standard version, as if it had been accumulating them from a much more recent date.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="15">There have been other recent hints of modern human interaction with archaic hominids, notably the finding in October that a lineage of body lice seems to have been inherited from a different human species.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">Stefansson said that another property of the inversion, though one not described in Monday's article, was that it is associated with longevity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="17">DeCode scientists have located two sites on Icelanders' genomes where there is some genetic variant that promotes longer lifespan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="17">The chromosome 17 inversion, it turns out, lies at one of these sites.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="17">It occurs at much higher frequency in women over 95 and in men over 90 than in the normal population.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="17">&quot;It seems to confer on people the ability to live to extreme old age,&quot; Stefansson said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">It is particularly surprising that the same genetic element should promote fertility and longevity, because most organisms are obliged to follow a strategy either of breeding fast during short lives or of living longer and having fewer children.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="18">&quot;Usually people think of there being a tradeoff between fertility and longevity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="18">So we are getting a free lunch here,&quot; said Dr. Alan Rogers, a population geneticist at the University of Utah.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">Stefansson said his findings were empirical observations for which functional explanations have yet to emerge.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="19">Despite the loose ends, other researchers seem impressed with the solidity of DeCode's findings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="19">&quot;It's a startling and amazing claim, and it's actually pretty convincing and compelling evidence at the same time,&quot; Reich said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">Alarmed by the rising consumption of  cannabis among French teenagers, the government on Wednesday  launched a 10-million euro (13 million dollar) campaign to warn of  the drug's harmful effects on physical and mental health.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">With more than one in five 18 year-old boys claiming to be  regular users -- and more than half of all 17 year-olds having  smoked cannabis at least once -- France has the highest consumption  rate in Europe along with Britain and the Czech Republic, according  to official figures.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">The media campaign -- including a series of radio and television  advertisements and the distribution of hundreds of thousands of  leaflets -- is to &quot;set the myth of cannabis against the reality in  order to debunk notions about its alleged harmlessness,&quot; the  ministry said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">Nearly 250 consultation centres are also to be established  across the country, and a telephone hotline set up to advise those  tempted by the drug.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="4">From the start of the next academic year, the  campaign will be extended inside secondary schools.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">According to the French Observatory on Drugs and Addiction  (OFDT), there are 850,000 regular consumers of cannabis in the  country -- of whom 450,000 smoke cannabis every day.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="5">The number of  17 year-olds who have experimented with it has doubled in ten years,  the OFDT calcalates.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">Toxicologists have established that the cannabis widely consumed  today is far stronger than the drug that became current in  university campuses in the 1960s and 70s, and warn that the  psychological damage is greatly underestimated.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">Among the harmful effects to be highlighted in the campaign are  memory loss, concentration lapses, altered perception and alienation  from friends and family.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">&quot;There is a syndrome of demotivation which results in a lack of  interest in school work and a gradual desocialisation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="8">At the same  time we now have proof of the link between cannabis abuse and  certain acute or chronic psychotic conditions,&quot; said Dr Michel  Reynaud, author of Cannabis and Health.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">Recent studies have established that cannabis can be a  contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">Concern over cannabis use has grown in recent years after a  series of fatal road accidents in which it was shown that the drug  was a cause.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="10">In 2003 a law was passed that makes driving under the  influence of cannabis a criminal offence, and urine tests are being  extended.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">&quot;Cannabis has been shown to be responsible for 20 percent of  accidents caused by people under 30 years of age,&quot; said Patrick  Mura, president of the French Society for Analytical Toxicology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">The government is also alarmed by the power of the drug economy  in the country's high-immigration city suburbs, to where much the  cannabis is initially smuggled from Morocco.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">At 76, Dr. James Watson has been recognized repeatedly for his brilliance and his life-altering discovery 50 years ago, along with a colleague, of the structure of DNA.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Remember that winding double-staircase known as the double helix that's recognized worldwide as DNA's model?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">That was his discovery.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">And that finding at age 25 led him to become a Nobel Prize winner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">This day, when we meet, he is being honored by the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression at a Palm Beach dinner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">He sits with members of NARSAD -- the president has a daughter with schizophrenia -- and we begin talking about his research into devastating mental illness and his quest to find the genes that produce these disorders.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">He has already found genes implicated in attention deficit disorder and Tourette's syndrome in children with autism.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">And we begin to talk about diagnostic testing -- when these genes are isolated.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">He thinks it's possible we could soon have a test, like that done for Down syndrome, for schizophrenia.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="7">Parents could find out when the child is still in utero if it was afflicted.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">(The same test, known as a DNA biopsy, might also be used in adults and children with schizophrenia to find genes that are damaged and then select the best therapy for them, similar to the way Herceptin is used in breast cancer and Gleevec is used for leukemia.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">&quot;We just have to spend the money ... if you were at war, you'd work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but that's not the way science is done,&quot; he says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="9">&quot;We don't have the money.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="9">We have no grants in support of this.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">I ask him why he has chosen to concentrate now on schizophrenia.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">&quot;We have a son who's been hospitalized with it,&quot; he answers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="13">There is a shocked silence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="13">No one knew.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">His son, now 35, hasn't responded to medication, he says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">I ask him about what seems the cosmic injustice: A man whose genius makes it possible for him to search out genetic causes for disorders to be a father to such a son.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">&quot;I just look at it as DNA can't be copied perfectly, and this has always been true, and it leads to a lot of inequality.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">A speech given a few years ago enhances his views.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">&quot;Random throws of the genetic dice during the formation of sperm and egg take away from too many infants the opportunity to participate in a meaningful life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="18">Those unfortunate individuals genetically programmed ... represent unambiguous tragedies lacking in any compensatory side advantages.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="18">Common sense tells me that no one is seriously harmed by steps taken to prevent the birth of such children,&quot; he has said.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="20">E-mail: carolyn--susman@pbpost.com</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">Australian researchers announced a  breakthrough Thursday in the search for the cause of schizophrenia,  linking the impaired thought processes involved with the disorder to  thinning grey matter in the brain.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">Vaughan Carr of the Neuroscience Institute of Schizophrenia and  Allied Disorders said the discovery could provide a better  understanding of the genetic causes of the illness and eventually  lead to improved treatments.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">&quot;The importance of this research is that it links together for  the first time abnormal brain structure and function in the one  image and ties that with abnormal thinking in schizophrenia,&quot; Carr  said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">&quot;Now this is a remarkable achievement.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">The researchers used advanced computing technology to give them  a &quot;new window&quot; into the brains of schizophrenia sufferers, Carr  said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">They examined the thickness and function of the brain in 10  Australian patients with early onset schizophrenia while they  performed a planning task involving attention and memory in a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">They compared the results with a healthy control group and found  those with schizophrenia had difficulty completing the task.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">The computer analysis showed impaired thought processes and  inability to problem solve among those with the debilitating mental  illness were directly related to the thinning outer layer of grey  matter and reduced activity of the affected part of the brain.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">Carr said the find, to be published in the international journal  Neuroimage, would open new areas of research examining post-mortem  tissue samples of the affected grey matter in schizophrenia  sufferers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">&quot;It means we can now focus on the genetics of a very specific  area of the brain and delve deeper and deeper into why the tissue  located there deteriorates in schizophrenia sufferers,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="11">Researchers hope to pinpoint genes that may be turned on or off  in schizophrenia sufferers, leading to possible new treatments.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="12">The mental disorder, which usually strikes people aged between  15 to 25, alters the way the brain functions and causes symptoms  including hallucinations, hearing voices, delusions and impaired  thinking.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="13">The research was done in collaboration with scientists in the  United States and Germany.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">In Dr. Huda Y. Zoghbi's laboratory at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, her research team has found the genetic roots of at least two crippling neurological diseases -- Rett syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxias.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">Recently, she and her colleagues identified a gene that regulates the growth of tiny inner ear hair cells, essential elements of hearing and balance in mammals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">For her findings, Zoghbi, a 50-year-old pediatrician who was born in Lebanon, has won major honors in the world of science, including her election to the National Academy of Sciences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">&quot;To me, women don't have to give up relationships to dedicate themselves to science,&quot; Zoghbi said over coffee at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan on a recent Saturday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="4">She is married with two children.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="4">&quot;My life is two things: the people I love and my work.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="4">With a little bit of organization, it can be done.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">Q.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">You started out as a neurological pediatrician.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="5">Why quit the clinic for the research bench?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">A. I got into research for emotional reasons.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="6">In 1985 when I was about to finish my neurology training, I was pregnant with my first child, Roula, who is now 20.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="6">It was very hard on me to be an expectant mother and meet parents whose children had neurodegenerative diseases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="6">It devastated me to say, &quot;Well, your child has a genetic disorder, and we can't do anything about it.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">I was fortunate that around that time I ran into Professor Arthur Beaudet, a genetics researcher, who said, &quot;I'll be happy to train you in molecular genetics.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="7">So I started over because I wanted to find a way to solve some of these terrible diseases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="7">At the beginning, I knew less than the technicians in his laboratory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">Q.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="8">How did you come to study the neurodegenerative disease known as Rett syndrome, which, I believe, strikes about 1 girl in 10,000?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">A.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="9">While I was still a resident, I met Ashley, a 5-year-old.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="9">She couldn't communicate, was having seizures and balance problems and was constantly wringing her hands.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="9">These are signs of Rett syndrome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">Her parents said she had started life as a perfectly normal girl and then at the age of 18 months, all of this became manifest.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="10">Knowing that Ashley started out as a healthy child, it was hard to get her off my mind.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="10">A week later, another little girl was brought to me with similar symptoms.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="10">This can't be that rare, I thought.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">So I went to medical records and found the charts of five more girls with symptoms that fit the diagnosis of Rett syndrome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="11">If I could identify about seven patients, I knew this was much more common than believed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="11">Moreover, I was intrigued by Rett syndrome, intellectually.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="11">I wondered what goes on with the brain of a child who starts out normally and then loses her communication and motor skills.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">Q.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="12">Have you unraveled the puzzle of Rett syndrome yet?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">A.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="13">Well, we've found the gene that, when mutated, causes Rett syndrome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="13">That's the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="13">Six years ago, we were able to clone it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">It turns out that this gene's mutations cause a lot more than Rett syndrome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="14">There are patients with it who get seizures and others who get autism.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="14">In rare cases, you even have bipolar disease and mental retardation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="15">A couple of patients with juvenile-onset schizophrenia also have this mutation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="15">So we think that the gene that's mutated in Rett syndrome is probably affecting many processes and neuronal activities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="16">It's the same for another neurological disease we study in my lab, spinocerebellar ataxia Type 1, which is also inherited.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="16">That's even rarer because only 1 in 100,000 people get it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="16">Yet, by studying it, we've learned that what happens to mutant proteins in the cell is the same as what happens to the proteins mutated in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="16">In all cases, the mutant proteins accumulate within neurons and are not cleared properly.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="17">So, if we can figure out how to deal with the proteins mutated in ataxia, similar approaches could be taken in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="17">By researching diseases that affect only a few people, we might solve others that affect many.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="18">Q.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="18">Why is it such a big breakthrough when you discover a gene that's associated with a specific disease?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="19">A.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="19">With Rett syndrome, it's helpful to the parents of these kids.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="19">Some thought they'd done something wrong and that's why their child was sick.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="19">Once we had the gene, they could see it was not their fault.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="20">In terms of research, finding the gene permitted us to make animal models of the disease.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="20">We can now engineer mice to carry this mutation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="20">It is possible to finally study the disease in the mouse, and to spare humans.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="21">Also, once you have the gene, drugs are a possibility.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="22">Q.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="22">The president of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, suggested that biological differences might explain why women had not advanced so much in the world of science.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="22">What was your reaction?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="23">A. I was disappointed by how he phrased his comments.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="23">When I read them, I worried about how a female graduate student would feel.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="23">My biggest concern was that these words might be taken by young female scientists to go, &quot;Oww, I might not make it.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="23">And that really upset me.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="24">In my own case, I've succeeded, in part, because I had a very supportive husband -- William Zoghbi, who is a professor of cardiology at Baylor.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="25">Dawna Armstrong, a Baylor pathologist, when my baby was 2 months old, she could see my guilt about being away from the baby and say, &quot;Huda, babies, they sleep all the time when they are this age.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="26">Q.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="26">Do you think there's such a thing as a female style of doing science?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="27">A. I think females communicate quite a bit, and that's important in a lab.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="27">Also, there are times when I follow my intuition.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="27">You think, &quot;I'm going to follow this, even though the data doesn't say I should.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="27">I do wonder if that intuitive approach is more prevalent among women scientists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="5" para="27">Lawrence Summers didn't talk about any of that.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="28">Q.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="28">What drew you to medicine in the first place?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="29">A. I grew up in an educated, cultured Beirut family.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="29">My mother urged me to become a pediatrician.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="29">I started medical school at the American University of Beirut in 1975.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="29">That was the year the civil war in Lebanon began.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="30">Bombs fell on the neighborhood of the university.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="30">My class was so determined to study that we attended lectures in the basement and we slept there at night because you couldn't go home.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="30">I found a corner of the ladies' room where I lived for most of the semester.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="31">At the end of that year, my parents sent me and my brothers to visit our sister, who was living in Texas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="31">They were afraid for us.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="31">While we were in the United States, the borders to Lebanon closed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="31">There was no returning.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="5" para="31">So Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., a traditionally African-American institution, accepted me two months after their term began.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="32">But as kind as they were, there I was, 21, alone in a new country, always worried about people back home: 150,000 people would die in the Lebanese civil war.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="32">Somehow I managed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="32">That year shaped me.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">Medical marijuana is now legal in 11 states, and bills to legalize it are pending in at least seven more.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="1">The drug is also at the heart of a case being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">Yet there remains much confusion over whether marijuana in fact has any significant medical effect.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">&quot;People subjectively report benefits,&quot; said Dr. Joseph I. Sirven, an epilepsy specialist and associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Scottsdale, Ariz. &quot;There's a whole Internet literature suggesting what a wonderful thing it is.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="3">But the reality is, we don't know.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">In an editorial last year in the journal Neurology, Sirven said the best studies of marijuana's effects on humans so far have shown little objective evidence of benefit in patients with epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="4">And a growing body of research indicates that, at least in teenagers, heavy marijuana use over a period of years significantly increases the risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="5">In the Supreme Court case, two California residents, Angel McClary Raich and Diane Monson, brought a suit against federal officials in October 2002 to defend their use of marijuana after six of Monson's marijuana plants were seized and destroyed by the Drug Enforcement Administration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="6">The federal government, which considers marijuana illegal under the Controlled Substances Act, asked the Supreme Court to overturn a Court of Appeals ruling that supported the two women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="6">Oral arguments were heard just after Thanksgiving and a ruling could come any day.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="7">Raich's physician, Dr. Frank Henry Lucido of Berkeley, Calif., asserted in an affidavit that Raich risked death if she was denied the marijuana to treat nausea, anorexia, severe chronic pain and other disorders brought on by a variety of illnesses, including post-traumatic stress disorder, asthma and an inoperable brain tumor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="7">On a Web site created on her behalf, www.angeljustice.org, Raich says she joined the lawsuit &quot;in order to save my life.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="8">While little scientific evidence supports such a lifesaving role for marijuana, many studies have found modest benefits in patients' subjective measures of pain, sleep, nausea, appetite, tremors and muscle spasms.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="9">&quot;There's nothing better for nerve pain than marijuana,&quot; said Phillip Alden, 41, a writer in Redwood City, Calif. Twice a month, he spends about $200 to buy a half ounce of high-potency marijuana from one of San Francisco's medical marijuana buyers' clubs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">He smokes it three or more times a day to treat pain from a back injury and to improve his appetite and reduce nausea associated with AIDS and the antiviral drugs he takes for it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="10">It has even checked the progression of his peripheral neuropathy, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">Two recent surveys published in Neurology have documented widespread use of marijuana among Canadian patients and a widespread belief in its benefits.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="11">The first survey, of 220 patients with multiple sclerosis, found that 36 percent had used marijuana to treat their symptoms and that 14 percent were using it at the time of the survey.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="12">The second, of 136 patients attending the University of Alberta Epilepsy Clinic, found that 21 percent had used marijuana in the previous year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="12">Just over two-thirds of the active users said it decreased the severity of their seizures and slightly more than half reported a decreased frequency of seizures.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="13">But the lead author of the epilepsy study said it proved only that some patients believed in marijuana, not that it or its active ingredients, called cannabinoids, actually worked.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="13">&quot;There's not been a randomized, controlled trial demonstrating that marijuana or any cannabinoid is any more effective in controlled seizures than a placebo,&quot; said Dr. Donald W. Gross, director of the University of Alberta's adult epilepsy program.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="14">Although doctors may now prescribe marijuana in Canada for certain disorders, including epilepsy, Gross said he had never done so.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="14">&quot;It's terribly complicated from a physician's standpoint, and somewhat frustrating,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="14">&quot;We have a product that has been legitimized without any evidence of efficacy.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="15">A large body of research in test tubes and animals supports the view that cannabinoids have anticonvulsive properties.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="15">But while a 2003 study of 657 patients with MS published in the journal Lancet found significant improvements in subjective reports of muscle spasms and pain, it found no improvement by objective measures after 15 weeks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="16">A follow-up report on the same group of patients did show modest benefit after 12 months, but the researchers said the results should be interpreted cautiously because the study had been intended to test only short-term benefits.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="17">Dr. David Baker, a professor at the Institute of Neurology in London, has found beneficial effects of cannabinoids in mice who have an artificially induced type of multiple sclerosis.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="17">But, he said, &quot;Showing clinical benefit in humans has been an elusive beast.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="18">&quot;At best there is a narrow therapeutic effect before the side effects become unacceptable for many people,&quot; he said. &quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="18">What is clear is that there have been no dramatic improvements overall.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="19">Dr. Kenneth P. Mackie, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of Washington, has devoted 15 years to studying the brain's response to cannabinoids through specialized brain receptors called CB1 and CB2.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="20">&quot;There's a whole bunch of theoretical reasons suggesting there would be a benefit for marijuana on a variety of conditions relating to pain and neuroinflammation,&quot; Mackie said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="20">&quot;But the clinical studies just aren't there.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="21">Far stronger evidence exists for a harmful effect of marijuana in teenagers who use it early and often.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="21">&quot;We know that cannabis is a contributory cause of schizophrenia,&quot; said Dr. Robin M. Murray, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and the co-editor of a new book, &quot;Marijuana and Madness: Psychiatry and Neurobiology.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="22">In a 2002 study published in the British medical journal BMJ, Murray reported that New Zealand teenagers who started smoking marijuana before age 15 and continued doing so on a daily basis raised their risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia from about 2 percent to as much as 10 percent.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="23">The study, he said, ruled out the possibility that the teenagers who used marijuana were also those who were more likely to develop schizophrenia, whether or not they used the drug.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="24">&quot;You have to take a lot to go psychotic,&quot; Murray said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="24">&quot;But with five joints a day for five years, an amount that is increasingly common in Europe, you're seriously increasing your risk of schizophrenia.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="25">But he added, the risk dropped sharply as people aged, so that most chronically ill people who used marijuana for medical purposes were unlikely to experience psychosis as a result.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="26">Research in the United States has been greatly hampered by legal restrictions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="27">In 1997, Dr. Donald Abrams, an oncologist and assistant director of the Positive Health Program at the University of California at San Francisco, became the first doctor authorized by the National Institute of Drug Abuse to receive marijuana to conduct research to determine if it provided medical benefits.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="28">Now more than a dozen California researchers are studying it under the auspices of the University of California's Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="29">&quot;Cannabis has a 5,000-year history of medical use,&quot; Abrams said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="29">He said he had completed three studies in patients with HIV that showed no negative effects on their immune systems or on the functioning of the protease inhibitor drugs they were taking.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="29">He is now trying to show that marijuana has a beneficial effect on immune functioning, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">About 1.47 million Ugandans are  suffering from sever mental illness, local media said on Friday  quoting a report dubbed &quot;Progress Report 2004-2005.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">This figure also accounts for the two percent of the population that suffers from epilepsy, one percent suffer from schizophrenia  and three percent maniac depression, according to the report.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">Uganda has a population of 26.8 million, according to the 2002  national population census.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="4">The report quotes World Health Organization statistics showing  that mental illness accounts for about 12.3 percent of the global  disease burden.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">&quot;This will rise to 15 percent by the year 2020 by which time,  depression will disable more than AIDS heart disorders, traffic  accidents and wars combined.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="5">The impact, both social and economic, on the lives of mentally ill people, their families and  communities is phenomenal,&quot; said the report which was carried out  by an international non-governmental organization, Basic needs UK  in Uganda (BUU).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">According to Dr. Margaret Mungerera, a senior psychiatrist at  Butabika National Psychiatrist Hospital, the number of people with mental disorders is likely to be high because the BUU study did  not cover the whole country</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">The study covered the districts of Kampala, Masaka, Hoima  Sembabule and Masindi.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="7">Uganda has a total of 56 districts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="8">&quot;Basing on what we see, the country might even be having a  bigger number of psychiatric victims.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="8">Take example of poverty  gibbering among the people, the northern Uganda war and the  changed lifestyle, all these can cause mental disorders,&quot; said Dr. Mungerera.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="9">At least 115 mentally ill people in Kampala and Sembabule were  cured of mental disorders and discharged during the study.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="1">IBM said on Monday that it is  teaming with a European institute in a research initiative to  uncover the secrets of human cognitive intelligence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="2">Scientists from IBM and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de  Lausanne (EPFL) of Switzerland will work together over the next  two years to create a detailed model of the circuitry in the  neocortex -- the largest and most complex part of the human brain, IBM said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="3">The scientists hope that by expanding the project, nicknamed  the Blue Brain Project, to model other areas of the brain, they  will eventually build an accurate, computer-based model of the  entire brain.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="4">Using the digital model created with IBM's Blue Gene  supercomputer, scientists will run computer-based simulations of  the brain at the molecular level, shedding light on internal  processes such as thought, perception and memory, IBM said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="5">The scientists also hope to understand more about how and why  certain microcircuits in the brain malfunction -- thought to be  the cause of psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia  and depression.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="6">&quot;Modeling the brain at the cellular level is a massive  undertaking because of the hundreds of thousands of parameters  that need to be taken into account,&quot; said Henry Markram, the EPFL  professor heading up the project.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="7">Under the initiative, IBM will install a Blue Gene  supercomputer at EPFL, with a peak processing speed of at least 22.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="7">8 trillion floating-point operations per second (22.8 teraflops),  making it one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="8">Markram is the founder of EPFL's Brain and Mind Institute,  where more than 10 years of research and wet-lab experiments have  produced the world's most comprehensive set of empirical data on  the micro-architecture of the neocortex.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="9">Researchers from IBM will use their experience in simulating  complex biological systems to help turn this data into a working 3- dimensional model re-creating the high-speed electro-chemical  interactions of the brain's interior.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="1">Identical twins possess exactly the same set of genes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="1">Yet as they grow older, they may begin to display subtle differences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="2">They may start to look different, develop different diseases or slide into different personalities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="2">Women who are identical twins may differ in their fertility or in the age at which they reach menopause.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="3">These discrepancies are usually attributed to ill-defined differences in environment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="4">But a whole new level of explanation has been opened up by a genetic survey showing that identical twins, as they grow older, differ increasingly in what is known as their epigenome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="4">The term refers to natural chemical modifications that occur in a person's genome shortly after conception and that act on a gene like a gas pedal or a brake, marking it for higher or lower activity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="5">Identical twins have the same set of epigenetic marks on the genome when they are born.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="5">But differences in the epigenome emerge as the twins grow older and become greater the longer they live apart, say a team of researchers led by Dr. Manel Esteller of the Spanish National Cancer Center in Madrid.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="6">Their report appears in Tuesday's issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="7">&quot;This is one of the most fascinating things I have read,&quot; said Dr. Nancy Segal, a psychologist who studies twins at California State University at Fullerton and the author of &quot;Indivisible by Two,&quot; a forthcoming book on twins.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="7">&quot;By giving us a handle on something specific it opens up many new avenues of inquiry as to why twins are different.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="8">There are two possible explanations for Esteller's findings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="8">One is simply the well- known fact that epigenetic marks are lost as people get older.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="8">Because the marks are removed randomly, they would be expected to occur differently in two members of a twin pair.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="9">A second possible explanation is that personal experiences and elements in the environment -- including toxic agents like tobacco smoke -- feed back onto the genome by changing the pattern of epigenetic marks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="10">Esteller believes he is seeing both processes at work.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="10">The evidence for the second process, he said, is that twins who reported that they had lived apart the longest also had the greatest differences in their epigenome.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="11">&quot;This is a way for the genome to be responsive to the environment,&quot; he said, noting that it is easier for chemical marks on the genome to change than for the genome itself to mutate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="12">His study suggests that the epigenome may be involved in many diseases that can affect identical twins differently, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and cancer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="12">Although schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, the epigenome may hold the clue to its nongenetic aspects.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="13">Differences between identical twins could also help pinpoint the epigenetic differences that contribute to cancer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="13">&quot;We think that epigenetic changes are very common in cancer,&quot; said Dr. Peter A. Jones, president of the American Association for Cancer Research and a professor at the University of Southern California.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="14">Jones said Esteller's finding &quot;is exceptionally interesting in that it underlines the importance of epigenetic changes in human development and disease.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="15">Jones recently convened a workshop to discuss starting an international human epigenome project.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="15">The proposal could rival the Human Genome Project in complexity because the human genome is the same in every cell of a person's body, while the epigenome is expected to be different for each of the 250 or so human cell types.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="16">Among the most important components of the epigenome are small chemical handles known as methyl groups, which are added directly to the chemical units of DNA.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="17">A wave of demethylation occurs in a sperm's genome shortly after an egg is fertilized, followed by the extensive readdition of methyl groups in early embryonic development.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="18">These methyl groups, which generally inhibit the activity of the genes in which they occur, tend to be lost during aging.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="18">Esteller's team studied the total amount of methylation in the twins' genomes, as well as another kind of epigenetic modification, the addition of acetyl groups to the histone proteins that act as a scaffolding and as a control system for DNA.</sentence>
