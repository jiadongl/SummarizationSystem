		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">An amendment to the 2005 defense authorization bill currently before Congress could immediately halt the development of offshore wind-power facilities in the United States, including a controversial project planned for coastal Massachusetts, environmental groups and developers said this week.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">The amendment is being pushed by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who sits on the House-Senate conference committee that will write the final version of the bill.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="2">The amendment would prevent the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees offshore wind power, from processing permit applications until lawmakers draw up new regulatory guidelines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">Proponents of the Massachusetts project say the amendment would stifle a burgeoning industry that they believe can make the United States less reliant on polluting fossil fuels at a time of rising oil prices.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="3">Warner, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the amendment is necessary to address shortcomings in oversight for such projects.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">``We need a more comprehensive regime, not unlike that for offshore drilling in the oil and gas industry, to protect this very important concept of wind energy, which I support,'' he said in a telephone interview.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">He would not disclose whether the amendment will be included in the committee's report, which could come as soon as Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="4">Once the bill is written, no changes can be made before a vote on passage.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">Although in its nascent stages in this country, wind power is widely used in Europe -- providing Denmark, for example, with about 18 percent of its energy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">The first offshore project planned for U.S. waters is a privately financed, $800 million proposal to build 130 turbines south of Cape Cod, Mass.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">Cape Wind Associates, the project's developer, says that in normal weather conditions, 40-story high towers could generate 170 megawatts -- 75 percent of the power used by Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">``This amendment would stop us dead in our tracks, putting the breaks on offshore wind energy for years to come,'' said Mark Rogers, communications director for Cape Wind.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">The Cape Cod proposal has sparked a strong backlash from a coalition of wealthy and well-connected opponents, including some environmentalists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">They say it will spoil the aesthetics of popular vacation communities, disrupt commercial fishing, and harm birds and marine wildlife.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">A 4,000-page draft environmental impact study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was completed last month after a nearly three-year process.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">It was set to be released last month, but a Pentagon official asked to review it first.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">``This project has undergone extensive environmental review, and the public has a right to learn what the implications of it will be,'' said Philip Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="10">``Clearly, there are powerful forces in Congress opposed to moving this project forward.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">A draft of the amendment, circulated this week, calls on Congress to outline environmental standards, establish requirements for competitive bidding and set public compensation for the use of waterways.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="11">Some of those issues were raised in a report last month by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which called the current regulatory framework for offshore wind power ``inadequate.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who serves on the Armed Services Committee and whose family owns a large home on Cape Cod, has spoken out against the project and supports establishing a national policy on offshore development.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">Warner, who has two daughters with summer homes on Cape Cod, wrote in a 2002 letter to Army Undersecretary Les Brownlee that ``the location of such a large project on Nantucket Sound is questionable.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">Warner said that the amendment is not related to his families ties to Cape Cod and that he is mainly concerned with providing a framework for wind-power developments in Virginia.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="13">A company called Winergy LLC applied for an offshore wind farm permit from the Norfolk District of the Army Corps of Engineers, but that application has been withdrawn.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">In New York, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) plans to build 40 wind turbines off southern Long Island as part of a state program that requires utilities to produce 25 percent of their energy portfolio from renewable sources by 2013.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="14">``We would be discouraged by any effort that would prevent us from moving forward with this important project,'' LIPA Chairman Richard Kessel said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Wind turbines have been hailed as an environmentally friendly way to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="1">But a wind farm with hundreds or even thousands of large turbines removes an enormous amount of energy from the air.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="1">So is wind power really benign?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">In one of the first studies to get at that question, scientists have modeled the impact of a hypothetical large-scale wind farm in the Great Plains.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="2">Their conclusion, reported in The Journal of Geophysical Research, is that thousands of turbines concentrated in one area can affect local weather.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">The impact, said the study's lead author, Dr. Somnath Baidya Roy, comes not so much from the turbines' rotor blades slowing down the air but from atmospheric mixing that occurs in the blades' wake.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">This creates warmer, drier conditions at the surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">&quot;We found that it's the turbulence generated by the rotor that is crucial when you talk about the impact on local meteorology,&quot; said Baidya Roy, who did the research at Princeton but is now at Duke.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">The simulated wind farm in the study consisted of 10,000 turbines, with rotor blades 165 feet long, in a 60-by-60-mile grid in north-central Oklahoma.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">In the Great Plains there is a nighttime stream of fast-moving air that separates cool, moist air near the ground from drier, warmer air above.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">The simulation found that the turbines catch this nocturnal jet, and the ensuing turbulence causes vertical mixing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">The warming and drying that occur when the upper air mass reaches the surface is a significant change, Baidya Roy said, and is similar to the kinds of local atmospheric changes that occur with large-scale deforestation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">&quot;You might see some kind of convective clouds or scattered rainfall here and there,&quot; Baidya Roy said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">He noted that the study was only preliminary, but that it pointed to the need to improve rotor design to reduce turbulence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">A wind farm of the size used in the simulation is much larger than those that have been built so far, Baidya Roy acknowledged, but it is not out of line with what is being considered as more power from renewable resources is sought.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">&quot;When you think of wind energy, people have a quaint idea of a lone windmill by the river,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="10">&quot;We are quite a ways from that, actually.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) will invest more than NT$10 billion in developing wind power generation in the next 10 years, a company spokesman said Sunday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">The 10-year development plan is part of the state-owed firm's efforts to substantiate the government's eco-friendly &quot;green power generation&quot; policy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">Under the plan, Taipower will install at least 200 wind power generators with a total installed capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, the spokesman said, adding that the wind power generators will first be set up in coastal regions in western part of the island.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">There is a &quot;think globally, act locally&quot; rightness to the fact that the environmental report for the Cape Wind power project came on the same day scientists laid out the dramatic effects global warming is having on the Arctic.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="1">The report on Cape Wind's 130-turbine proposal finds few costs to marine or bird life that might outweigh the project's benefits to both the environment and the economy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">The 454-megawatt project would provide a source of pollution-free, renewable power that could displace fossil fuel sources in the region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="2">Unless the United States and the rest of the world get serious about global warming and sea-level increases, the Cape town of Orleans could be &quot;under the waves&quot; by 2100, according to Philip Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">Much of that increased ocean water will come from the Arctic.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="3">It is warming more than the rest of the planet, according to the report by the eight-nation Arctic Council, which includes the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="3">As ice and snow at the poles melt, the loss of their reflective surfaces leads to exposed land and water absorbing more heat.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="4" para="3">The four-year study by 300 international researchers advances the consensus among scientists that industrial society's increasing production of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, is causing climate change.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">The Bush administration has refused to take any steps to curb carbon dioxide emissions despite a promise by President Bush in 2000 to do so, and has indicated it has no plans to change that policy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="4">This leaves it up to states like Massachusetts, which requires utilities to increase annually their use of renewable power sources, and California, which is pioneering a requirement that motor vehicles reduce their carbon emissions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">If Washington cannot take the lead in coping with climate change, the least it could do is provide legislation for a better framework for wind or other renewable energy projects that use the ocean surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">But Congress has not made significant progress in passing a bill to create a leasing system for sites similar to one that exists for offshore oil and gas drilling.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="5">The lack of such a framework is no reason to stall the Cape Wind project, which is now a step closer to becoming a model for offshore wind power generation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">Using current technology, it is more practical to build offshore turbines fairly close to land, which means they can be visible in nearby communities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="6">The environmental report, prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers, includes a &quot;visual impact assessment&quot; by an architectural historian who states that the turbines &quot;will have an adverse visual effect&quot; on historic properties and locations in the area.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="6">That may not be pleasant for some residents, but the supposed harm to a view is more than offset by the beneficial impact of the clean Cape Wind power.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">As the clock begins ticking Tuesday toward a final decision on the proposed wind farm in Nantucket Sound, its chief opponent said the government should allow more time for public response to a crucial 4,000-page report that appears to pave the way for its approval.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">The new draft environmental impact report, prepared over three years by the Army Corps of Engineers, will be released in full Tuesday, but supporters and opponents responded to details that became public Monday morning.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="2">The findings are largely favorable to the project, suggesting that the 130 turbines proposed off Cape Cod would have little or no negative effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animal life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">The public has 60 days to comment on the report before the Corps issues a final version and makes a decision on the project, which is expected next year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">The report is by far the most important hurdle the controversial project must overcome before construction begins.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="4">The draft gives the first public look at the federal government's official stance on the 460-megawatt power plant.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, a group founded to block the project, said Monday that it intends to ask the government to extend the comment period to six months, saying that two months is too little time for the public to digest the enormous amount of information in the Army Corps report.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">&quot;A 60-day comment period during the holiday season on a complex and controversial project is unfair,&quot; said Susan Nickerson, of the alliance.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">Army Corps officials said Monday they would consider written requests to extend the comment period, but had already added 15 days to the minimum required time of 45 days.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">Even though few had seen the entire report by Monday afternoon, reaction was swift from opponents and supporters after details were published by news agencies and summaries of the report were leaked.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="8">The two sides have begun lining up engineers and scientists to start poring over the document.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">&quot;The struggle has just begun,&quot; said Charles Kleekamp, vice president of Cape Clean Air, an environmental group that supports the farm.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">Governor Mitt Romney, who opposes the project on aesthetic grounds, says the report downplays a key consideration for Massachusetts residents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="11">&quot;I'm not surprised that the wind farm isn't going to kill fish or kill birds,&quot; said Romney.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="11">&quot;The question is does the wind farm impinge on the beauty of one of the great natural resources on the East Coast, and it does.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="12">Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers said few projects are blocked because of aesthetic considerations, in part because it is such a subjective matter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="12">Supporters of wind farms have called the proposed turbines &quot;futuristic&quot; and &quot;beautiful,&quot; while opponents have called them a blight on an uninterrupted seascape.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="13">The Nantucket Sound wind farm, proposed by Cape Wind Associates, would be the country's first offshore wind farm.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="13">A host of politicians have attempted to block the project since it was proposed three years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="14">If the Army Corps sticks to the 60-day public comment period, the agency is likely to issue a decision next year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="14">Construction could begin soon afterward.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="15">&quot;This is great news for citizens hoping to turn decades of rhetoric into action on renewable energy,&quot; Cape Wind president Jim Gordon said, referring to the report's findings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="16">The $13 million draft environmental impact report was paid for by Cape Wind.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="16">Some 16 agencies and groups weighed in with comments and data about potential impacts the farm would have, and the Army Corps received hundreds of individual comments.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="17">Cape Wind's involvement in the report has drawn critics, including Nickerson, who says the Army Corps was overly reliant on data collected by consultants paid for by the developer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="17">They also faulted the Army Corps' hiring of TRC, a national engineering firm with an office in Lowell, to help put the federal document together.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="17">Nickerson said TRC would be bound to write a favorable review because it works on wind issues, among others.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="18">Army Corps officials said they specifically hired TRC as an independent third party because they have an energy background and experience with similar reports.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="18">A spokeswoman for TRC said Nickerson's comments were untrue.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="19">&quot;TRC deals with all kinds of energy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="19">The idea they would be biased to any particular energy source is ridiculous,&quot; said spokeswoman Samantha Guerry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="20">Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose family compound would overlook the project, issued a statement saying the project shows the need for better rules to govern what he sees as the bequeathing of public ocean to private interests.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="21">Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said &quot;We cannot allow the federal government to give away 24 square miles of pristine waters to a private developer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="21">... [W]hat is happening here is wrong.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="22">With promises of an enormous fight brewing, both sides remained optimistic.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="22">Marc Breslow, director of the Massachusetts Climate Action Network, which supports the plan, said he had only seen a brief summary of the report Monday, but if it is accurate, &quot;completion of a final [environmental report] should be done expeditiously, and assuming no environmental surprises, Cape Wind should move forward without further delay.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="23">Beth Daley can be reached by email at bdaleyglobe.com</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">Nantucket Sound lies between Cape Cod, Nantucket Island and Martha's Vineyard, some of the nation's best-known vacation spots.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="1">Now a private company is proposing to build the world's largest offshore wind power plant right in the middle of it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="1">Depending on who is talking, the results would be either a hideous blot on the landscape or a significant step toward clean power and energy independence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">The argument over the proposal intensified last week, when the Army Corps of Engineers issued a draft environmental impact statement finding few flaws in the proposal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="2">But instead of helping to settle the question, the report fed the debate over building there and where -- or whether -- other wind farms should be built in the nation's coastal waters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">The 4,000-page draft gives new support to environmental groups that praise the project as a safe, nonpolluting and desperately needed alternative to fossil fuel power plants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="3">But opponents challenge the report, the process that produced it and the idea of building the turbine array in the first place.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">Regardless of its environmental impact, they say, it is just too ugly -- an industrial development that would wreck pristine vistas in a major tourism area.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="4">Many add that no offshore energy projects should be considered until the government establishes a better review process for proposals to use federal lands offshore.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">The project would be the nation's first offshore wind power plant, and it is being closely watched up and down the Eastern Seaboard.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">A similar proposal is under consideration off Jones Beach, on Long Island, and officials in New Jersey are looking into offshore wind power.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">The Corps of Engineers' draft concluded that the project, proposed by Cape Wind Associates of Boston, would not unduly hinder ferry operations, commercial and sport fishing, boating, aviation or other activities at its site, a 24-square-mile area in the part of Nantucket Sound called Horseshoe Shoals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="6">It said the project's 130 support towers, turbines and blades, which together would rise about 420 feet above the water, would not seriously affect currents, waves, water quality, sand movement, fishing conditions or noise levels.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">Adequate steps can be taken to protect marine mammals and shellfish, the report said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="7">Birds will fly into the towers and die, the statement says, but probably at a rate of only about one a day, not enough &quot;to cause bird population declines.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">And while opponents predict that the field of towers would drive away tourists, the corps said the project might actually attract sightseers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">The report is preliminary, and the public will have at least until Jan. 10 to comment on its findings, said Karen Adams, who supervises the permit process for the Corps of Engineers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="9">A final environmental review may be completed as soon as a year from now, she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Cape Wind, said the company must still raise the capital needed to build the project.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="10">But if all goes well, he said, the plant could be producing power as early as 2007.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="10">The power would go into the regional grid, not precisely to Cape Cod and the islands, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="10">But on a day with average wind, it would produce about 420 megawatts -- three-fourths of average electricity needs for the local area.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">&quot;Many of the more hysterical fears that opponents had been speaking of in the past three years were not supported in this analysis,&quot; Rodgers said of the impact statement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">But that is no surprise, according to the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, an organization that opposes the wind farm.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="14">As is required, Cape Wind paid for the work that went into the report.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="14">&quot;As a predictable result,&quot; the alliance said in a statement, &quot;the document is strongly biased toward Cape Wind.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="15">Adams and the project's supporters dismiss that criticism.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="15">The corps requires applicants to pay for studies of their proposals, she said, because it would not be right for taxpayers to pay for them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="15">The corps independently chose the experts who produced each section of the report, she said, and Cape Wind willingly financed whatever the work the corps requested.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="16">She added, however, that some in the corps did not expect to find themselves in the position of issuing federal permits for the project.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="16">&quot;We had to do a lot of learning real quick,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="17">But some officials -- including Gov.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="17">Mitt Romney, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Bill Delahunt, whose congressional district includes the project site, say the project should not go forward yet.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="17">They say offshore projects of all kinds need a more systematic federal review process.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="4" para="17">(Sen. John Kerry says he will await the final environmental impact statement before taking a position.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="18">(STORY CAN END HERE.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="18">OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="19">Advocates of the wind farm say establishing such a process would only mean unnecessary delay.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="19">And several environmental organizations have found themselves in the unaccustomed position of praising the Corps of Engineers, which many have criticized in the past as being too quick to approve development projects.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="20">&quot;At first, obviously, it was pretty frightening because of their history,&quot; said Kert Davies, U.S. research director for Greenpeace, which favors the project.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="20">But he added, &quot;I think the effort was very solid, and they were under a lot of scrutiny.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="21">Davies also dismissed as &quot;an elitist and local view&quot; assertions that the wind turbine array would spoil a pristine environment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="21">Nantucket Sound is far from that, he said, filled as it is with &quot;mega boat traffic and jet skis and fishing boats and ferries -- it is not the Grand Canyon these guys are painting it to be.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="22">Others say that regulatory issues aside, the aesthetics are perhaps the biggest issue standing in the project's way.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="22">&quot;It's a legitimate concern,&quot; said Bruce Bailey of AWS Truewind, a research firm in Albany, N.Y., that consulted on the Cape Wind project.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="23">But, he said, &quot;It's based on expectations, not based on what people have actually seen.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="23">He said photo simulations of what the wind farm will look like from shore -- it will be 4.7 miles away at its closest point -- assume the clearest of weather conditions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="23">Often, he said, the distant view from shore is obscured by haze, so the turbines would not be so obvious.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="24">Besides, advocates say, a diminished view is a small price to pay for clean power.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="24">&quot;If we are not willing to accept that tradeoff, I think it says something pretty profound about our priorities and our commitment to moving to cleaner sources of electricity,&quot; said Randy Swisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy Association, which represents developers, suppliers, consultants and others in the wind power industry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="25">The corps' statement did not address in detail another criticism opponents have voiced: that the project is economically viable only because of tax credits or because the federal government is giving the company free use of the site, issues that some say should be considered in a broader federal review of development of offshore lands.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="26">But advocates contend that all kinds of fossil fuel energy projects benefit from federal incentives.</sentence>

Kremers, a 19-year-old sophomore at Colorado State University here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="1">He's been there and done that.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">Kremers sold wind power to the occupants of individual dormitory rooms this fall, under a deal between the university and the local utility that environmentalists describe as one of the first such programs in the nation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">Kremers, an environmental engineering major and the associate director of environmental affairs in the student government, gave out stickers and pinwheels shaped like turbines and threw a &quot;wind power party&quot; to celebrate clean energy, complete with a cake connived from the dining hall.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">He ultimately got 187 students -- nearly 4 percent of the university's 5,000 residence-hall population -- to sign up, paying from $17 to $52 a year extra to buy green power to run their computers and lava lamps.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="7">The new law, called Amendment 37, makes Colorado the 18th state with an environmentally friendly energy standard, but the first one to have bypassed the Legislature and put the rule into place through referendum.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="7">An energy bill similar to the one the voters approved was defeated by Colorado's legislature three times in the last three years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="8">&quot;Because it's a conservative Western state with a strong fossil-fuel industry, as well as the first one passed by a popular referendum, Colorado represents something of a breakthrough,&quot; said Alan Nogee, the energy program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit research and advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="9">And Fort Collins, a city of 118,000 people dominated culturally by the 25,000-student university got there first.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">The city created its own wind energy program in 1998, and its own renewable energy standard in 2003 -- a step that only a few other municipalities in the nation, notably Chicago and Austin, Texas, have taken.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">Under the program, about 2 percent of the city's customer base and electricity load now comes from wind power, purchased from wind farms in Wyoming through a nonprofit power authority.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="11">The idea is that each purchase of wind power fed into the grid offsets fossil-fuel use.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="11">Colorado gets most of its electricity from burning coal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="12">It was from that municipal utility framework, city and school officials say, that the dormitory project took root.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="12">And just like Amendment 37, which clawed its way onto the ballot through petitions, what happened on the campus came entirely from the bottom up.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="12">People like Kremers and a former student, Britta Schroeder, his predecessor at the student government's environment job, prodded and pushed until they found a way.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="13">&quot;It was almost all exclusively the students doing this,&quot; said Carol Dollard, a utility engineer at the university who got involved in the residence hall project.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="13">The pitch to the administration, she said, was that wind energy would be an entirely optional added cost for students, and that the grunt work would be done by the students themselves.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="13">&quot;We sold it as zero cost, zero effort,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="14">Kremers, who has a quotation from Gandhi on the door of his dorm room -- &quot;Be the change you wish to see in the world&quot; -- considers the new state law a wonderful boost to what's happening on campus.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="15">Fort Collins officials are more guarded.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="15">They say that as one of a small number of &quot;home rule&quot; cities that run their own electric systems in Colorado, they want to opt out of the new state law because they believe their energy program is better.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="16">It is certainly more ambitious, requiring 15 percent of the energy sold in city limits to come from wind sources by 2017, 50 percent more than the state requirement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="16">City officials also don't like the idea of interference by the state Public Utility Commission, which will oversee the statewide standards, and they worry as well that the Legislature could amend the plan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="17">The Fort Collins city council voted to remain neutral on Amendment 37 before the election.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="17">Statewide, the measure got the support of slightly more than half the electorate -- 53.4 percent voted for it, to 46.6 percent against.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="18">&quot;We will be closely watching what happens.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="19">Environmentalists who backed Amendment 37 noted that it includes specific language intended to protect Fort Collins, and other cities that might join its ranks with local standards, allowing them to self-certify out of the program.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="20">But they also admitted that because the measure was passed as an ordinary state law, it could be amended by the Legislature -- or repealed, though hardly anyone expects that to happen -- and that the Public Utility Commission will also have to work out the details of enacting it over the next year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="21">&quot;It's a statute, so the legislature can change it however it sees fit, but I would hope that since it was passed by the voice of the people, they would respect that,&quot; said the measure's principal author, Rick Gilliam, a senior energy policy adviser at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit environment law and policy center.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="21">&quot;My hope is that we would at least go forward into the PUC realm before the legislature tinkers with it.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="22">Dollard, the utility engineer, said that one proposal would extend the wind power option to individual professors, and departments that might want to buy some or all their energy from the city's wind program.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">Green Mountain Energy is offering Texas electricity consumers an environmentally friendly service at a rate matching that of Reliant Energy -- a sign of a growing interest in green energy and the rising price of traditionally produced power.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">Touted as a &quot;pollution free&quot; plan, Green Mountain Energy gets the power it sells from wind turbines and hydroelectric plants and will cost about 11.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, the same price current Reliant Energy customers are paying.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">Houston-area electricity customers can pay as little as 9.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, a rate offered by Houston-based Gexa Energy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="3">Other companies, like Starlight Electric and Cirro Energy, also offer rates below the price Reliant charges.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="4">The Green Mountain plan, a 10 percent wind- and 90 percent water-generated mix, is about $9 per month less expensive than the 100 percent wind plan Austin-based Green Mountain currently offers, based on the use by a typical customer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">The new offering reflects a maturing of the electricity market from one where only early adopters would pay the extra money for green power to a market where renewable power is attractive to a broader range of customers, said John Savage, Green Mountain's senior vice president of marketing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">&quot;Some see it as a way to counter the country's dependence on foreign oil; others see it as a way to promote good environmental stewardship, and others see it as being consistent with their faith.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="6">Savage said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">The power in Green Mountain's 100 percent wind plan comes from turbines operating in Texas, but most of the hydroelectric power in the new plan is generated in neighboring states, such as Arkansas and Oklahoma, Savage said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="8">While the power that arrives at a Green Mountain customer's home in Texas won't necessarily be from a hydroelectric plant, Green Mountain will buy a sort of &quot;renewable power credit&quot; from a hydro plant that generated the electricity and sold it to another user.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="9">Green Mountain's plan also reflects the narrowing price gap between renewable power and power made by more traditional methods, such as coal and natural gas, said Tim Morstad, an analyst with Consumers Union.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="10">Since 2002, the price electric consumers pay to Reliant Energy, known as the price-to-beat, has gone up 28 percent, or 2.48 cents per kilowatt-hour.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="10">Most of that is a result of rising costs, primarily natural gas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="11">&quot;On the renewable front, it does bode well that customers can choose more environmentally friendly power for the price most residential customers pay,&quot; Morstad said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="11">&quot;But this is also a signal that the price to beat has gotten very high.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="12">The cost of renewable energy hasn't necessarily dropped, either.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="12">While the cost of wind power is supposed to stay relatively stable compared with power generated by coal and natural gas, Green Mountain recently increased the price of its 100 percent wind product.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="12">Because the company must buy some power on the open market to meet customer needs, it is also subject to the fuel price increases imposed by its suppliers, Savage said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="13">Reliant Energy does not offer a renewable energy plan in the Houston area -- state electricity deregulation laws allow it to offer only one plan here until Jan. 1, 2005 -- but it has offered a plan to Dallas-area customers for several years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="14">Jim Robb, Reliant's senior vice president of retail marketing, said the renewable plan has been priced to roughly match the cost of the Dallas area's incumbent provider, TXU.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="14">The power comes from a combination of wind and landfill-produced natural gas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="15">&quot;We haven't seen major evidence of increased interest in a renewable product,&quot; Robb said, noting that about 1,400 customers have signed on to its plan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="15">&quot;We could offer such a plan in Houston next year if we find customer demand, but we haven't gone to the expense of marketing the plan.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="16">There are no other renewable energy plans offered in the Houston area.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="16">Spokesmen for Entergy and TXU note that renewable sources are part of their mix of power generation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="16">TXU is the fourth largest contractor of wind power in the country, while Entergy has several hydroelectric facilities.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="4">And that raises a question: With government under pressure to develop renewable energy, will controversial alternatives be foisted solely on poorer, less politically influential areas?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="5">The proposed Nantucket Sound project would be the country's first offshore wind farm.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="5">The structures would stretch 417 feet high from the water's surface to the tallest blade tip and would be visible 4 miles away on Cape Cod and more distantly from Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="3" para="5">Some environmental groups, including the Conservation Law Foundation and Greenpeace believe the trade-off in terms of energy and pollution savings is worth it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="5">But Cape Wind Associates, the developer behind the proposal, is fighting the wealthy and well-connected, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other Kennedy kin along with some average Cape residents.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="6">As for Romney's loud opposition, the governor could be feeling pressure from Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's strong effort to challenge the project.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="7">Opposition to Cape Wind is organized through the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, which spent $2.4 million fighting the proposed wind farm in 2003.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="4" para="8">It concluded that lower property values, reduced tourism revenue, and a loss in year-round jobs would result from the wind farm.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="5" para="8">The Egan Family Trust owns property in Cotuit overlooking Nantucket Sound, and Michael Egan owns a home on Great Island, off Yarmouth, overlooking Nantucket Sound.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="9">Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the alliance, said, &quot;This is not a political issue at all.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="9">Opposition is &quot;a matter of common sense.&quot;</sentence>
