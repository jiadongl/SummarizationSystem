NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with knowledge of the case.
NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.
