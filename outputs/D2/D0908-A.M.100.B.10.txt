The leader of Nepal, King Gyanendra, unexpectedly dissolved the government and claimed absolute power Tuesday, justifying the moves as necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of a Maoist insurgency that has spread to nearly every corner of the picturesque Himalayan nation.
Japan, the top donor to aid-dependent  Nepal, on Thursday voiced concern at King Gyanendra's power grab and  urged him to restore democracy and release any detained political  leaders.
