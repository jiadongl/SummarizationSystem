(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in   the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard  has been postponed.
Shepard died following a brutal beating in Laramie in October.
Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell moved the start of the trial for   Russell Arthur Henderson from March 22 to April 6 due to a  scheduling conflict involving one of the attorneys.
Police have said the attack was motivated in part because he was  gay.
