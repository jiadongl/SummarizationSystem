		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Some Texas geologists believe the best way to get rid of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is to simply put it back where it came from.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">On Monday, scientists began burying 3,000 tons of compressed carbon dioxide 1 mile beneath an old oil field near Dayton.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="2">If the plan works, most carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas -- could be captured from area smokestacks and stored harmlessly underground, not pumped into the atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">&quot;We're going to test every aspect of this to determine whether it is safe,&quot; said lead researcher Susan Hovorka, with the University of Texas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">So-called carbon sequestration is not a new idea.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">Scientists have experimented with storing the gas on the ocean floor and thousands of feet below ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">Norway has already buried nearly 70 million tons below the North Sea in the space where it had extracted fuels.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">Annually, man-made sources of carbon dioxide emit 7 to 10 billion tons of the gas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">Capturing a major chunk of those emissions, and storing them deep below ground, could ease global warming problems, scientists say, while giving the world time to move away from fossil-fuel dependency.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">The effort by UT geologists, in conjunction with scientists from other labs nationwide, is the first major attempt to determine whether the sandstone layer beneath the Texas and Louisiana coasts makes a good carbon dioxide reservoir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">For the next two weeks, trucks from Baytown and Louisiana will deliver compressed carbon dioxide to the site in Liberty County.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">Using a modified oil well, the researchers will pump the gas into sandstone deposits 5,050 feet below ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">There the gas -- so compressed it is almost a liquid -- soaks into the sandstone and saltwater, like bubbles in Coca-Cola, Hovorka said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">Among the team's concerns is that too much pressure may cause the shale layer atop the sandstone to crack, or might even cause a small earthquake.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">But Hovorka said such problems can be solved by closely monitoring the pressure where the gas enters the ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">As for leaks, the research team has calculated that just 1 percent of the gas will seep into the atmosphere after 300 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">The group has chemically &quot;tagged&quot; the gas they are burying so they can measure if any returns to the surface in the coming weeks and months.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">Even at relatively high concentrations, carbon dioxide is not harmful.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="15">After all, anyone who drinks a carbonated beverage inhales it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">And now the gas is simply being dumped into the atmosphere, so a little returning to the surface poses no danger, Hovorka said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="17">Environmentalists said the plan is worth pursuing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">&quot;If it's something that can be done reliably and safely, then this is one way to mitigate against the impact of greenhouse gas emissions,&quot; said Ramon Alvarez, an atmospheric scientist in the Texas office of Environmental Defense.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Should burying the carbon dioxide below ground prove safe and reliable, the next hurdle will be cost, scientists say.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">Removing carbon dioxide from fossil fuel fumes would be expensive, as would building the infrastructure to transport the gas below ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="20">But Hovorka said the price tag would not be exorbitant.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">For pennies on the dollar more than current electric rates, she said, people could use fossil fuels with cleaner air and consciences.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Less than a decade ago, the idea  of capturing and storing the carbon gases blamed for driving the  Earth towards climate-change peril was usually dismissed with a  laugh.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">But a top scientific forum here shows how far the argument for  carbon sequestration has come, with a series of experts insisting it  can be transformed from fiction to fact.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">Driving their case is the fear that time is running out for  dealing cheaply with the carbon pollution spewed out by fossil  fuels.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">These emissions trap the Sun's heat and disrupt Earth's fragile  climate system, with potentially catastrophic effects a few decades  from now.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">Their focus is on power stations which burn oil, gas and coal,  and whose pollution is set to soar in coming years as China and  India, the two world's most populous countries, meet surging needs  for energy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">Sequestrators say carbon dioxide (CO2) would be captured using  solvents, either before or after the fossil fuel is burned in the  plant.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">The CO2 would then be pumped out, sometimes over hundreds of  kilometers (miles), to disused oil and gas fields up to one  kilometer (3,250 feet) underground, and stored.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">It would not be the miracle cure to global warming or switch off  the dependence on fossil fuels that are the source of the problem,  they admit.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">Even so, &quot;it can play a global role, making very large and very  rapid reductions of CO2 emissions,&quot; Jon Gibbins of Imperial College  London said on Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">He pointed to a pilot scheme in the North Sea as proof of its  feasibility.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">An experiment in Norway's offshore field, Sleipner, has been  storing a million tonnes of waste CO2 per year since 1996, pumping  it 1,000 metres (3,250 feet) below a cap of shale and mudstone.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">Another project is in North America, where CO2 is being  extracted from a coalgas plant in Wyoming and pumped 300 kms (185  miles) to Weyburn, in Canada's Saskatchewan province, where it is  stored in an empty underground chamber in a working oilfield.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">Environmentalists say the answer to global warming is to slash  emissions themselves and swiftly wean the world off dirty fossils  and onto renewable sources and hydrogen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">They also warn that the stored carbon is simply a bequeathed  hazard for future generations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="14">If the geological storage tank leaks  or is breached by an earthquake the outpouring of CO2 would  instantly damage the world's climate system.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">Gibbins says former oil and gas fields in sedimentary basins,  but also many types of water aquifers, are excellent options for  safe storage: &quot;We are looking at 90 percent retention [of the gas]  for 1,000 years.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">Taking out the CO2 from fuel is called &quot;carbon neutral,&quot; in  other words not adding further to emissions from that source.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">But a more ambitious possibility is &quot;carbon negative,&quot; or  removing CO2 from the atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">That could be done by biofuels, suggests Peter Read, a professor  at Massey University in New Zealand.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">Plants suck CO2 out of the air as part of photosynthesis.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="19">By  growing plants, burning them in fossil-fuel power stations and then  sequestrating and storing the carbon, a dent could be made on ors would increase by 62 percent.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">During the same period, world electricity demand is projected to  double, with fossil fuels supplying most of the need.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">The three-day conference, ending in this southwestern city on  Thursday, focussed on scientists' latest assessment of the global  warming problem.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">President Bush, in one of the least-noticed gestures of his European visit, has pledged to help developing nations such as China and India cut back on their fast-growing output of the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">Bush signed a pact with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday to help poorer countries adopt more energy-efficient technologies in power generation, transportation and industry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">Although the agreement lacked specific commitments for new spending, diplomats and analysts say it could help take political pressure off the United States, the world's largest polluter, and remove a major obstacle to achieving the goals set out in the Kyoto Protocol, the agreement on climate change that went into effect Feb. 16 despite a U.S. boycott.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">The Bush-Schroeder agreement &quot;can be very meaningful as a start.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="4">It can get the United States and developing countries on board,&quot; said ZhongXiang Zhang, an energy and climate policy analyst at the East-West Center, a think tank in Honolulu.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">The Kyoto Protocol's weak point is that even as wealthy nations cut back on pollution, greenhouse gas emissions from China, India and other developing nations keep rising at a sizzling rate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">China's emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, are rising at more than twice the rate of the United States, while Germany's overall output is dropping.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="6">In fact, China is widely projected to overtake the United States as the world's top source of greenhouse gases by 2025.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">&quot;China is building a new 1,000-megawatt power plant every week with old, Eisenhower-era technology,&quot; said Douglas Ogden, director of the China program at the Energy Foundation in San Francisco.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="7">&quot;They're going to keep building the oldest, dirtiest plants unless we do something.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="7">The world can ill afford even one greenhouse gas producer on the U.S. scale, let alone two.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">China and other developing nations are exempted from the Kyoto Protocol's rules for emission cutbacks because their governments are afraid the limits would hobble their rise from poverty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">&quot;The European side wants hard targets from the United States and developing countries, which is ... very difficult,&quot; Zhang said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="9">&quot;But if they can work together to subsidize advanced technologies ... it would be very positive.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">The key to the U.S.-German initiative is the most polluting of major energy sources -- coal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">Schroeder and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are pressing Bush to join them in creating an ambitious aid program to help developing nations adopt new technologies that reduce emissions from coal power plants and save energy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="11">Blair holds the annual rotating presidency of the G-8, the group of industrialized nations, and he says he will make the proposal a top priority for the group's summit meeting in July.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">Although environmentalists advocate the expansion of wind and solar energy production, China and India are expected to continue to rely on their huge reserves of coal for most of their energy needs in the near future.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="12">The two countries derive 80 percent and 65 percent, respectively, of their electricity from coal, compared to the U.S. share of 51 percent.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="13">&quot;Coal is really the workhorse for the economies of India and China in the decades to come, so that's why coal is so important for global warming,&quot; said Bernd Kramer, minister counselor for science, technology and environment at the German Embassy in Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="14">In the next eight years, China expects to put into operation 562 coal-fired plants -- nearly half the world's total -- and India is projected to add 213 such plants, according to government figures.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="14">The United States is expected to build only 72.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="15">For years, the U.S. government has invested heavily in clean-energy research.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="15">For 2005, it budgeted nearly $3 billion for research and development of climate-change technology, mostly through subsidies and tax breaks for work on hydrogen fuel-cell developments and so-called clean coal technology, which releases less carbon dioxide.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="16">Hydrogen fuel cells are widely believed to be 15 to 20 years away from commercial viability, while clean-coal technology is already on the market.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="16">The most prominent clean-coal method goes by the cumbersome name of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle, or IGCC.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="16">Under the process, coal is turned into a gas, which is then burned in a process that allows carbon dioxide to be siphoned off rather than released into the atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="17">Plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxide and can be combined with a futuristic option called &quot;carbon sequestration,&quot; in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected into oil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="18">What is needed now is not further research but aid to get these two methods to market, say Schroeder, Blair and many experts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="19">One prominent environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, has estimated that the extra cost of using IGCC and carbon sequestration in all plants being built in developing nations would be just $6 billion a year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="20">&quot;This amount would be a huge investment in global security, and it is very low compared to the $50 billion that the G-8 gave in development assistance last year,&quot; said David Hawkins, the council's climate policy director.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="21">If China, India and other nations start snapping up this new technology, a big winner could be San Francisco's Bechtel Corp., which has already built two coal-fired power plants and two nuclear plants in China, with several more under construction or projected.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="21">Bechtel recently formed an alliance with General Electric Co. to develop IGCC power plants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="22">Amos Avidan, a principal vice president of Bechtel, said China is eager to make its power plants cleaner and reduce the nation's severe air pollution.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="23">The IGCC technology &quot;hasn't yet taken off,&quot; Avidan said, &quot;but we believe it can become a mainstream technology in a couple of years or so and eliminate the cost gap.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="23">We think it has great potential for China.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="24">Other industry analysts are more skeptical.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="25">&quot;The problem with these leapfrog technologies is they have a well-proven track record of mostly failing,&quot; said Dale Simbeck, vice president of technology for SFA Pacific Inc., a Mountain View energy industry consulting firm.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="26">He noted that there are only two IGCC power plants operating in the United States, despite two decades of federal subsidies.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="26">One failed attempt was the Pinon Pine power plant, an IGCC plant near Reno completed in 2000 at a price tag of $335 million, split equally between a local power company and the U.S. Energy Department.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="26">The plant has been plagued by technical snafus and has never been fully operational.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="27">Simbeck, who has worked as a consultant on China power issues for the World Bank and the Chinese government, said China has enough technological know-how.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="27">Its main barrier, he said, is rigid government policies that shield state-owned power companies from competition.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="28">&quot;The Chinese are just telling the West what it wants -- 'Help us build with IGCC, please help fund these with our companies' -- but it's not necessary,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="29">Lee Schipper, director of transportation research for World Resources Institute in Washington, said China's reputation as a big polluter is unfair.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="29">The Beijing government is spending billions of dollars annually on pollution prevention, he noted.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="30">China's efficiency programs are getting a boost from European and Bay Area experts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="30">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is working with the Energy Foundation on a host of programs, ranging from consumer appliance standards to building codes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="30">And the California Air Resources Board has helped Chinese federal and state governments set up air-quality monitoring programs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="31">&quot;China is improving at many times the rate of improvement in the United States,&quot; Schipper said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="31">&quot;The Bush administration should be getting its own carbon house in order instead.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">Almost a decade ago, Tampa Electric opened an innovative power plant that turned coal, the most abundant but the dirtiest fossil fuel, into a relatively clean gas, which it burns to generate electricity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="1">Not only did the plant emit significantly less pollution than a conventional coal-fired power plant, but it was also 10 percent more efficient.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Hazel R. O'Leary, the secretary of energy at the time, went to the plant, situated between Tampa and Orlando, and praised it for ushering in a &quot;new era for clean energy from coal.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="2">Federal officials still refer to the plant's &quot;integrated gasification combined cycle&quot; process as a &quot;core technology&quot; for the future, especially because of its ability -- eventually -- to all but eliminate the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">Since that plant opened, however, not a single similar plant has been built in the United States.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="3">Abundant supplies of natural gas -- a bit cleaner and, until recently, a lot cheaper -- stood in the way.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">But even now, with gas prices following oil prices into the stratosphere and power companies turning back to coal, most new plants -- about nine out of 10 on the drawing board -- will not use integrated gasification combined-cycle technology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">The reason is fairly simple.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">A plant with the low-pollution, high-efficiency technology demonstrated at the Tampa Electric plant is about 20 percent more expensive to build than a conventional plant that burns pulverized coal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="5">This complicates financing, especially in deregulated markets, while elsewhere utilities must persuade regulators to set aside their customary standard of requiring utilities to use their lowest-cost alternatives.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="4" para="5">(A federal grant of $143 million covered about a fourth of the construction cost of the Tampa Electric plant, which was originally a demonstration project.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">The technology's main long-term advantage -- the ability to control greenhouse gas emissions -- is not winning over many utilities because the country does not yet regulate those gases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">That could be a problem for future national policy, critics say, because the plants being planned today will have a lifetime of a half-century or more.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">&quot;It's a very frightening specter that we are going to essentially lock down our carbon emissions for the next 50 years before we have another chance to think about it again,&quot; said Jason S. Grumet, the executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">The commission, an independent, bipartisan advisory body, has recommended that the federal government spend an additional $4 billion over 10 years to speed the power industry's acceptance of the technology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="8">In a recent report, the commission concluded that &quot;the future of coal and the success of greenhouse gas mitigation policies may well hinge to a large extent on whether this technology can be successfully commercialized and deployed over the next 20 years.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">Grumet was more succinct.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="9">Integrated gasification combined cycle technology, combined with the sequestration of carbon stripped out in the process, &quot;is as close to a silver bullet as you're ever going to see,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">Until Congress regulates carbon emissions -- a move that many in the industry consider inevitable, but unlikely soon -- gasification technology will catch on only as its costs gradually come down.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="10">Edward Lowe, general manager of gasification for GE Energy, a division of General Electric that works with Bechtel to build integrated gasification combined-cycle plants, said that would happen as more plants were built.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="10">The premium should disappear entirely after the first dozen or so are completed, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">Even now, Lowe said, the technology offers operational cost savings that offset some of the higher construction costs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="11">And if Congress eventually does limit carbon emissions, as many utility executives say they expect it to do, the technology's operational advantages could make it a bargain.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Cinergy, a heavily coal-dependent Midwestern utility, is one of the technology's biggest industry supporters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="12">&quot;I'm making a bet on gasification,&quot; he said, because he assumes a carbon-constrained world is inevitable.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="12">&quot;I don't see any other way forward,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">The operating savings of such plants start with more efficient combustion: They make use of at least 15 percent more of the energy released by burning coal than conventional plants do, so less fuel is needed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="13">The plants also need about 40 percent less water than conventional coal plants, a significant consideration in arid Western states.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">But for some people, including Rogers and other utility leaders who anticipate stricter pollution limits, the primary virtue of integrated gasification combined-cycle plants is their ability to chemically strip pollutants from gasified coal more efficiently and cost-effectively, before it is burned, rather than trying to filter it out of exhaust.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">Proponents say that half of coal's pollutants -- including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to acid rain and smog -- can be chemically stripped out before combustion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="15">So can about 95 percent of the mercury in coal, at about a tenth the cost of trying to scrub it from exhaust gases racing up a smokestack.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">The biggest long-term draw for gasification technology is its ability to capture carbon before combustion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="16">If greenhouse-gas limits are enacted, that job will be much harder and more expensive to do with conventional coal-fired plants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="16">Lowe, the GE executive, estimated that capturing carbon would add about 25 percent to the cost of electricity from a combined-cycle plant burning gasified coal, but that it would add 70 percent to the price of power from conventional plants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">Gasification technology, although new to the power sector, has been widely used in the chemical industry for decades, and the general manager of the gasification plant run by Tampa Electric, Mark Hornick, said it was not difficult to train his employees to run the plant.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="17">Tampa Electric is the principal subsidiary of TECO Energy of Tampa.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">Disposing of the carbon dioxide gas stripped out in the process, however, is another matter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="18">Government laboratories have experimented with dissolving the gas in saline aquifers or pumping it into geologic formations under the sea.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="18">The petroleum industry has long injected carbon dioxide into oil fields to help push more crude to the surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="19">Refining and commercializing these techniques is a significant part of a $35 billion package of clean energy incentives that the National Commission on Energy Policy is recommending.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="19">The Senate considered some of those ideas in a big energy policy bill last week, but it is doubtful whether Congress will approve the funds to enact them because they are tied to regulating carbon emissions for the first time, something that many industry leaders and sympathetic lawmakers oppose.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="20">(STORY CAN END HERE.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="20">OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="21">Still, the energy bill may have some incentives for industry to adopt gasification technology, and the Department of Energy will continue related efforts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="21">These include FutureGen, a $950 million project to demonstrate gasification's full potential -- not just for power plants but as a source of low-carbon liquid fuels for cars and trucks as well, and, further out, as a source of hydrogen fuel.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="22">Regardless of the politics of carbon caps, the Energy Department has made it clear that it intends to push the development of integrated gasification combined-cycle technology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="22">Last month, for example, Mark Maddox, a deputy assistant secretary, said at an industry gathering that the technology &quot;is needed in the mix -- needed now.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="41">He added that the teams have discovered even deeper waters that are unconnected to the surface and will probably stay pure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="41">But the isotope-dating methods show that these very deep aquifers are old and not undergoing renewal, calling for careful conservation.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="42">The flow of detailed hydrological information, he said, has been &quot;a tremendous boost&quot; to the government's understanding and has helped it make substantial changes in policy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="42">&quot;Part of solving the problem,&quot; Aggarwal said, &quot;is to understand its origin and extent.&quot;</sentence>

		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="1">SEARCH IS ON FOR A WAY TO TRAP PLANET-HEATING CARBON DIOXIDE Moving in Washington and financial categories for release Sunday, Aug. 21.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="1">WASHINGTON -- With the world poised to generate huge volumes of carbon dioxide in the next 25 years, experts say the need to capture the planet-heating gas and store it in safe places is becoming urgent -- and increasingly feasible.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="2">Using available technologies, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be captured and pumped into geologic formations deep underground, scientists say.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="3">The technique might add as little as 25 cents to the cost of a gallon of gasoline or $40 a month to a typical residential electric bill, a Princeton University scientist estimates, and the cost would be expected to fall as innovations are developed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="4">A group at Arizona State University is investigating another approach, with estimated costs that are considerably higher but coming down.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="4">It would involve combining CO2 with plentiful minerals to form substances that would be chemically stable for millions of years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="5">The cost of allowing the heat-trapping gas to remain in the atmosphere could be far higher.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="6">Nearly all atmospheric scientists believe that increases in CO2 and other &quot;greenhouse gases&quot; have caused the Earth's surface temperature to rise.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="7">Many fear the concentration is approaching the point known as &quot;dangerous anthropogenic interference,&quot; when altered weather patterns, rising and acidified seas, and other unforeseen changes could bring about global havoc.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="8">Nevertheless, projected economic growth over the next few decades imply drastic increases in the atmospheric concentrations of the dominant greenhouse gas, CO2, which is produced by the combustion of coal, petroleum and natural gas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="9">The scale of the imminent increases is illustrated by a United Nations projection that the amount of electricity produced in the world's coal-burning power plants will double between 2002 and 2030.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="10">Robert H. Socolow of Princeton University has calculated that the pollution produced by these plants during those 28 years will include approximately 501 billion tons of CO2.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="11">That's almost as much CO2 as scientists believe coal burning has vented into the air since the turn of the 17th century, the time of William Shakespeare.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="12">&quot;If we're going to build that many coal plants, we're going to make one hell of an impact on the planet,&quot; Socolow said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="12">&quot;I think it's obvious that a substantial fraction of that carbon dioxide should not be allowed to enter the atmosphere.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="13">Socolow and ecologist Stephen Pacala, co-directors of the Princeton Carbon Mitigation Initiative, say the world must move rapidly to develop a combination of strategies, from the use of carbon-free alternative energies to the capture and storage of CO2, in order to reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="14">Removing CO2 from power plant emissions is not as difficult as it might sound.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="15">About 15 percent of the flue gas from a traditional coal-fired power plant is carbon dioxide, Socolow said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="16">If droplets of chemicals known as amines are sprayed through the flue gas in a chamber known as an absorption tower, the CO2 will stick to the amines, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="17">Then, under heat, the amine-CO2 combination breaks apart, freeing the amine chemical to be routed back into the absorption tower to collect more CO2.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="18">The next step, Socolow said, is to compress the CO2 into what's called a &quot;supercritical&quot; fluid, almost as dense as water.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="19">Socolow said a 1,000-megawatt coal plant would produce about 50 million barrels of supercritical carbon dioxide per year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="20">Several ways of storing the captured gas are being explored.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="21">In one strategy, being explored by physicist Andrew Chizmeshya and chemist Michael McKelvy at Arizona State University, the supercritical CO2 would be combined with abundant surface rocks to form permanent carbonate compounds.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="22">If a common rock called serpentine is ground and mixed with water and supercritical CO2 in a solution Chizmeshya likens to &quot;dirty soda pop,&quot; the CO2 combines with the serpentine to form magnesium carbonate, or magnesite, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="22">The mineral is stable for millions of years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="23">The procedure would add $200 to the cost of using a ton of coal, but Chizmeshya said this is dramatically below the estimated cost when they started working on the system five years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="24">He and McKelvy said they believe they have the solution to a problem that could lower the cost even more.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="25">The alternative approach of injecting the captured CO2 underground would not be a totally new technology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="26">In fact, the energy industry now injects compressed carbon dioxide into the ground to pressurize oil or gas reserves and make it easier to get the fuel out of the ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="27">Also, Norway uses a deep below-ground disposal system for carbon dioxide removed from natural gas in a purification step.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="28">Socolow said new technologies like carbon dioxide storage, sometimes called carbon sequestration, will not work unless society decides to put a price on simply venting the gas into the atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="29">&quot;Investment in technology is, I think, necessary, but there will be no actual the large-scale implementation of the technology until it is cheaper to put it underground than to pay the tax to emit it,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="30">That would imply caps on emissions or a carbon tax, both of which have been non-starters with the Bush administration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="31">However, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman recently announced that the government would spend $100 million on moving &quot;sequestration technology from the laboratory to the field.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="31">He said that would bring the country &quot;a step closer to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the important role coal plays in America's energy mix.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="32">Socolow said experts have calculated that the cost of pumping the gas into deep caverns would be about $25 a ton, or about $60 for every ton of coal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="33">By the time the cost is passed through the coal and power industries to the consumer, the cost of a kilowatt hour of electric power would probably go up 20 percent, or $40 on a $200 monthly home power bill, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="34">But that's too much, said Paul N. Cicio, executive director of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="35">&quot;If my members' energy cost goes up 20 percent, they're out of business,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="36">He says his industry supports Bush administration initiatives to develop new technologies and energy efficiencies, but costly CO2 capture and storage efforts will work only if competing economies such as China and India do likewise.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="37">John Topping, founder of the Climate Institute, an environmental organization devoted solely to climate change issues, agreed with Socolow and Pacala that a combination of strategies is urgently needed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="38">&quot;We need to find ways to make renewable fuels and nuclear power more competitive, and to get these coal plants to start sequestering CO2, and to develop a clean hydrogen fuel system and do a lot of other things,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="39">&quot;It may be a little bit here and a little bit there, but if something is not done soon, we're just going to be piddling into the wind,&quot; he added.</sentence>
