	<Sentences>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Still without approval from baseball club owners or the city they plan to call home, the Washington Nationals were born Monday in a sea of red, white and blue.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="1">These are not your grandfather's Washington Nationals, because those Nationals played in the American League and were alternately called the Senators.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">The new National League Nationals were named not only before they have approval to play in the nation's capital, but also before they have a new owner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">Major League Baseball, the owner of record, has moved so slowly on the transfer and the sale of the team that a new owner isn't guaranteed to be in place in time to make marketing plans for next season or to have a say in off-season player decisions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">For what some people expect to be $400 million to $500 million, the new guy doesn't get to name his team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">&quot;We need a name for marketing,&quot; Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, said Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">&quot;We're not going to have an owner for some time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="5">What if we don't have an owner by the start of spring training?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">Nearly 30 individuals or groups have submitted expressions of interest in buying the team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="6">Baseball expects about half of that number to bid seriously when the time comes to put up their money.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">One owner said Monday that he believed the leading contender for the team was Mark Broxmeyer, a Long Island builder, but another hopeful said there was no way anyone could be a leading contender because the first dollar hasn't been bid.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">If there is a leader in the bidding, having nothing to do with finances, it could be the group headed by Stan Kasten, who for many years was the president of the Atlanta Braves.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">Kasten has been exploring multiple opportunities in multiple sports, but if he decides to reach for the Nationals, he would have an advantage over other prospective buyers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">Why?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">Study recent baseball history.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="9">The winning bidder for the Boston Red Sox three years ago was John Henry's group, which was loaded with baseball people who had a close relationship with Commissioner Bud Selig.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="9">He might not have known it at the time, but Cablevision's Charles F. Dolan never really had a chance.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="9">Kasten has had a good, long relationship with Selig.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">The Washington bidding will be a show worth watching.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="10">Not long after Major League Baseball took control of the Expos, baseball people talked about an eventual sale bringing in $400 million, giving the other 29 teams a rewarding payday for their $120 million purchase.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">Then the economy turned south, and some people felt baseball would be fortunate to get $200 million.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="11">Maybe that's why baseball officials dragged their feet in deciding where to put the Expos.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="11">They were trying to wait out the economy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">Time hasn't done much for the economy, but it did give baseball time to find a knight on a big white horse.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">The Washington mayor, Anthony Williams, came riding in and pledged that the District of Columbia would build a new ballpark for the new team, whatever the cost, which some estimates say could exceed $600 million.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">The new owner, whose team will play at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium for the first three seasons, will have what might be the best stadium deal ever.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="13">The Nationals will pay nothing for the construction of the park, pay $3.5 million a year for rent and receive all stadium-related revenue from tickets, concessions, parking, signs and naming-rights fees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">The prospect of getting that combined revenue and money from a regional sports network to be shared with the Baltimore Orioles will drive up the sale price.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">A financial investment adviser said Monday that he would never advise a client to pay $400 million for the Nats, although maybe $300 million, but he acknowledged the possibility that some bidder might make a $400 million bid if he really wanted the team and wanted to break away from the crowd.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">Just like the old Nationals, who became the Senators in 1957, these Nationals will have the right to change their name.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="16">&quot;When they move into the new stadium, the owner will have the right to petition to change the name,&quot; DuPuy said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="17">Club owners are expected to approve the team's move within the next two weeks, whether or not baseball officials have concluded an agreement with Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, on compensation for intruding on what he considers his turf.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="17">The Washington city council will vote on stadium financing next month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">Meanwhile, even though no owner is in place to decide which players he might want or how much he would spend on them, Jim Bowden continues to do his job as interim general manager.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Bowden has already demonstrated his acumen in running a low-budget operation, having served as general manager of the economically deprived Cincinnati Reds for 10 1/2 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="19">And in the space of a few days last week, Bowden signed half an infield's worth of free agents -- third baseman Vinny Castilla and shortstop Cristian Guzman -- and traded for a productive, if volatile, outfielder in Jose Guillen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">Bowden hasn't been told if he can exceed the $41 million payroll with which the Expos opened last season, but baseball officials have estimated that the Nationals will take in at least $100 million more in revenue than the Expos did.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="20">That should give Bowden a little more to play with.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">Even if he doesn't know who the new owner will be.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Major League Baseball owners Friday conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington for the upcoming season.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">The approval was &quot;subject to all conditions set forth in the Baseball Stadium Agreement,&quot; signed by the Expos and Washington Mayor Anthony Williams.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="2">The agreement calls for the District of Columbia government to enact funding for a new ballpark by December 31.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">&quot;This is another important step in finalizing the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC,&quot; baseball commissioner Bud Selig said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">&quot;We are looking forward to finishing the last few steps, including the sale of the ballclub, and the rebirth of the club as the Washington Nationals.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">The last time a major league club moved cities was after the 1971 season, when the Washington Senators became the Texas Rangers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">Until a new ballpark is built, Washington will play at RFK Stadium.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">bb/nr04</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">Major League Baseball on Wednesday rejected as &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot; a stadium financing plan approved the day before by the Washington City Council, throwing into grave doubt the city's plans to bring the former Montreal Expos here next season.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">Baseball's statement came in response to legislation the Council approved late Tuesday night requiring that half of the riverfront stadium's projected $280 million construction costs be paid for privately, delivering a stinging rejection of a deal struck by Mayor Anthony Williams and baseball officials to finance the ballpark almost entirely with tax dollars.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">On Wednesday, a grim Williams expressed pessimism that his plan could be salvaged.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="3">&quot;I do think baseball is in jeopardy,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="3">&quot;The dream of 33 years is now close to dying.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">Critics of Williams' plan said he was exaggerating the threat that Major League Baseball would take the team, renamed the Nationals, to another city.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="4">They said baseball had few alternatives, since the Nationals are scheduled to play next season in Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington while their new home is built.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="4">Once the team is in Washington, the city's negotiating position will be strengthened, they argued.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">But in a statement, Bob DuPuy, president of Major League Baseball, called the legislation &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot; and gave the city until Dec. 31, the previously agreed upon deadline, to approve the original financing deal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="5">After that date, baseball said, it will begin considering other sites.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">&quot;The legislation approved by the District of Columbia City Council last night does not reflect the agreement we signed,&quot; the statement said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">DuPuy said baseball had stopped promotional activities for the Nationals and would refund deposits for season tickets.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">Under the deal Williams reached with baseball owners to bring the Expos to Washington next spring, less than 20 percent of the stadium would have been financed by private funds, specifically through rent payments from the team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">Amid the uncertainty, the one clear thing on Wednesday was the stark and surprisingly forceful message the Council sent about growing public resentment toward the high cost of sports stadiums.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">With land acquisition and service improvements, Williams had projected that the total stadium package would cost $440 million.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="10">But the city's chief financial officer has put the cost closer to $535 million, and other estimates have gone higher.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">The White House said Thursday it hoped that the city of Washington and Major League Baseball could still reach an agreement that would bring a professional team to the US capital city.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">US President George W. Bush, an avid fan and former team owner, &quot;thought it was great that baseball would be coming to Washington,&quot; spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="2">&quot;Hopefully, they'll be able to work things out.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">The District of Columbia Council has voted to require private financing for at least half the construction costs of a new ballpark for the Nationals -- the former Montreal Expos, who are due to kick off next season in their new city against Arizona on April 14.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">&quot;The legislation is inconsistent with our carefully negotiated agreement and is wholly unacceptable to Major League Baseball,&quot; MLB president and CEO Bob DuPuy said in a statement a day after Tuesday's vote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">In the initial agreement between the team and Washington Mayor Anthony A. Williams, the city was to be responsible for 531 million dollars in bonds to finance the stadium plan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">But under the legislation approved by the council, 50 percent of the costs must come from private financing, or the approval for the plan expires.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">With the new provision in place, the Nationals may have to reopen bidding for a permanent home if private financial obligations are not met.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">Asked whether Bush supported public financing for sports stadiums, McClellan replied: &quot;Those are local decisions.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">The city's top two political leaders cleared the way Monday night for Major League Baseball in the nation's capital, after daylong negotiations to guarantee the construction of a stadium that baseball officials demanded to relocate the former Montreal Expos here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">The city's mayor, Anthony A. Williams, and the City Council chairman, Linda W. Cropp, agreed, together with baseball officials, to alterations in the deal the mayor made with Major League Baseball in September that used mostly taxpayer dollars for stadium construction.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">Cropp wanted to minimize the use of public money to build a stadium, which has been estimated to cost as much as $585 million.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">The compromise will be voted on Tuesday by the full 13-member council at its last meeting of the year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">Cropp persuaded fellow council members last week to adopt an amendment requiring private financing for the new stadium, where the renamed Washington Nationals team would play.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">The compromise reached late Monday assures that 50 percent of the stadium will be privately financed, said the mayor's spokesman Chris Bender.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">Several private financing possibilities already have been investigated by city officials, Bender said, including a parking meter plan that is expected to generate $100 million in upfront revenue for the city.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="7">If no other private deals are found, Bender said, the city expects to sign onto the parking arrangement offered by the Cleveland-based Gates Group.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">In return for assurances that private financing is viable, Cropp said she would drop her legislative language requiring a specific amount of private financing, a demand which had aroused the ire of baseball supporters since they feared that it would torpedo the team's chances of moving here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">Baseball officials also agreed to reduce the $19 million in damages the city would incur if the new stadium, to be built by the Anacostia River in Southeast Washington, did not open by March 2008.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="9">Instead, the city would forfeit a $5 million yearly rental payment it would earn when the Nationals team plays at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, which it is set to do beginning in 2005.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">Baseball officials also agreed to split the cost of construction insurance with the city to limit taxpayer liability, Bender said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="11">Williams said that having a team was not just about baseball, but also &quot;about revitalizing the Anacostia River, creating new jobs, bringing in new tax revenues and creating a new source of civil pride.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">Baseball fans in the nation's capital can start dreaming again about their first opening day in 33 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">The District of Columbia Council voted 7-6 Tuesday to approve legislation clearing the way for the Montreal Expos to move here next season and be renamed the Nationals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="2">The measure allows the city to sell up to $584 million (euro436 million) in bonds for construction of a 41,000-seat stadium about a 1.6 kilometers (one mile) south of the Capitol, and for renovations to RFK Stadium, where the team will play next year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">Ticket and team merchandise sales were to resume Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="3">They were suspended for a week because of uncertainty caused by changes the council had made in the city's agreement with the team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">&quot;The Nationals are finally rounding third and heading for home,&quot; said Mayor Anthony A. Williams, who negotiated the move with major league baseball officials.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">Williams said he will sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk, leaving only baseball commissioner Bud Selig's approval of the RFK renovations for the move to become final.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">The Nationals' home opener on April 14 would be the first regular season major league game in the city since the Senators left to become the Texas Rangers after the 1971 season.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">The city almost struck out a week earlier when the council amended Williams' deal with baseball officials to require that half the construction costs be paid privately, or it would be voided.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">Baseball officials balked at the provision and threatened to take the team elsewhere if the original deal wasn't approved by Dec. 31.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">But Williams won the necessary votes after he, Cropp and baseball officials compromised during a day of intense negotiations Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">The final bill calls for the city and baseball to split the cost of insurance that would limit the city's liability on cost overruns or construction delays.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="10">That amendment, introduced by Cropp, also reduces compensatory damages for the first year if the stadium is finished late.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="10">Instead, the Washington Nationals would not have to pay $5.3 million (euro3.96 million) in rent if the ballpark is not ready for the 2008 season and the team has to remain at RFK.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">A second amendment, approved 10-3, deletes a sunset provision that would have canceled the deal if there was no private financing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">Baseball officials were pleased with the vote and the guarantees that the stadium would be built as planned, Selig said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">&quot;We are also pleased that our discussions with Washington's elected leaders over the last several days have helped each side better understand the concerns of the other,&quot; Selig said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="13">&quot;We are now more confident than ever of a long and productive relationship with the city of Washington as we move forward with this great project.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">Williams sent Cropp a letter Tuesday, noting his commitment to include private financing in the stadium package.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="14">If there is no better proposal, Williams wrote, he will use a proposal from the Cleveland-based Gates Group that would provide $100 million (euro74.66 million) in return for parking revenues near the stadium.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="15">Supporters of the measure also made some parliamentary maneuvers to ensure the bill could not be reconsidered next year, when three new members who oppose the stadium project begin their terms.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">The Washington Nationals will make  their debut in the nation's capital when they host the New York Mets  in a major league baseball exhibition game on April 3.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">The game will be played at RFK Stadium, which will serve as the  Nationals' temporary home before their new stadium is constructed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">Formerly the Montreal Expos, the Nationals were officially  relocated to Washington last month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">After the move was approved the team's future in the District of  Columbia briefly seemed in jeopardy when stadium funding hit a snag,  but local officials have since approved a plan for public funding of  a 400 million-dollar stadium.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">The Montreal Expos can move to Washington, change their name and never play the Canadian national anthem again, but they cannot seem to go anywhere without the New York Mets following along for a photo-op.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">Despite everything that has changed with this vagabond franchise, its trusty sidekick remains the same.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="2">More than 35 years after the Mets welcomed the Expos to the major leagues and more than five months after they ushered them out, the Mets once again rode shotgun into history on Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">The spring training schedule-makers have quite a sense of symmetry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="3">The Expos played their first regular-season game against the Mets in 1969 and their last game against the Mets on Oct. 3, so it was only fitting that the Washington Nationals would play their first game against the Mets on opening day in the Grapefruit League.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="4">If anyone missed the nostalgic significance of the event, the Mets will travel to Washington for the Nationals' first game at RFK Stadium, an exhibition on April 3.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="4">By the end of the regular season, these two National League East companions will have met 26 times.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="4">&quot;It's getting really weird,&quot; Washington outfielder Brad Wilkerson said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="4">&quot;It's always us and them.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">In the first regular-season game between thesefranchises, Tom Seaver started for the Mets at Shea Stadium and Coco Laboy powered the Expos to an 11-10 victory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="5">In their last meeting, Tom Glavine started for the Mets at Shea and Todd Zeile homered to deal the Expos an 8-1 defeat.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="5">On Wednesday at Space Coast Stadium, Glavine started again for the Mets and the Nationals came back for a 5-3 victory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">&quot;To start the last game and start the first game,&quot; Glavine said, &quot;that's pretty cool.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">The Mets can take solace in lessons of the past.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="7">When they dropped the opener to this franchise in 1969, they went on to win the World Series.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="7">&quot;Maybe that's an omen for our team,&quot; said Mets outfielder Ron Calloway, who came over from the Expos this winter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="7">&quot;Or maybe it's just a reach.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="8">To celebrate their first game, the Nationals wore their regular-season home uniforms instead of their batting-practice jerseys.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="8">They got their first hit from shortstop Christian Guzman and their first home run from outfielder Jose Guillen, both off-season acquisitions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="8">The Nationals have sold 20,000 season-ticket packages in Washington, but they drew a more modest sellout of 7,558 in Viera on Wednesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="8">After the third inning, there was still a traffic jam outside the stadium, with ticket-holders trying to get into the grass parking lot.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="9">&quot;There is a lot of enthusiasm and anticipation,&quot; Washington manager Frank Robinson said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="9">&quot;There is interest in this ball club that hasn't been there before.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="10">The Nationals were not the only players on a new team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="10">Doug Mientkiewicz started his first game for the Mets at first base and made a nifty scoop on a double play.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="10">Kazuo Matsui started his first spring-training game at second base and successfully charged two grounders, bare-handing one and short-hopping the other.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="10">Carlos Beltran was in the Mets' lineup for the first time and went 1 for 3 with a searing single.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="5" para="10">&quot;I was a little nervous,&quot; Beltran said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="6" para="10">&quot;But that's just me.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="11">With Mike Piazza and Cliff Floyd back in Port St. Lucie, and Mike Cameron rehabilitating from wrist surgery, Beltran was the second-most popular reason to watch Wednesday's game.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="11">&quot;Whenever I throw my last warm-up pitch, I always turn around to make sure everybody is ready,&quot; Glavine said after working two shutout innings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="11">&quot;To see the new guys we had out there, and to see Carlos in center field, it was a good feeling.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="12">Even the Mets' rookie manager, Willie Randolph, was bouncing out of the dugout to greet players coming off the field.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="12">After the Mets hired Randolph in November, one of the first congratulatory calls he received was from Robinson.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="12">And after Randolph put on a Mets' uniform for the first time last month, one of his first calls was to Robinson.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="13">This game will undoubtedly be remembered as the Nationals' introduction to baseball, but it also included two African-American managers who have relied on each other for support.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="14">&quot;I think Willie is going to do really well,&quot; Robinson said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="15">Randolph seemed much more comfortable than Omar Minaya, the Mets' general manager, who could be forgiven for forgetting for a day which organization signs his paycheck.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="15">Minaya, the Expos' general manager the past three years, helped make the Nationals a competitor and the Mets a contender.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="15">In the first of many reunions with his former team, Minaya wore a blue hat with a white M on the front.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="15">The hat was not a new style released by the Mets.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="5" para="15">It was worn by the Montreal Royals, Jackie Robinson's first professional baseball team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="16">&quot;I'm happy today, and I'm also a little bit sad,&quot; Minaya said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="16">&quot;I'm happy for Washington, but I'm sad for Montreal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="3" para="16">It can be sort of emotional.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="4" para="16">There is a lot of newness here today.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="17">As a sign that not everything had changed, the former first-round draft choice Aaron Heilman allowed three runs in two innings for the Mets, wasting a pair of run-scoring hits from Jason Phillips.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="1">The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="2">It is time for Major League Baseball to stand up to Peter G. Angelos.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="3">Mr. Angelos, majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles, has used the threat of litigation and a flair for brinkmanship to cast a pall over the start of Washington baseball's first season in 34 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="3">The city's new team, the Nationals, begins regular season play Monday, with a home opener set for April 14, and it remains without a deal to televise its games.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="3">Whatever the local enthusiasm for the Nationals -- and it appears to be enormous -- the absence of a television broadcasting outlet is an impediment that will undercut early attempts to market the new team and give it a running start.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="4" para="3">This is unacceptable, and it is largely the doing of Mr. Angelos.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="4">Mr. Angelos opposed bringing baseball to Washington on the grounds that it might further damage his Orioles franchise, whose fortunes have nose-dived in the 12 years since he purchased the team.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="4">In that he may have a point; last week, the Orioles reported that ticket sales were running 12 percent behind last year's level.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="4">He has insisted that Major League Baseball should compensate him for the revenue he believes the Nationals will leech from the Orioles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="4" para="4">According to published reports, he has already received from baseball officials a guaranteed minimum price of $365 million should he decide to sell the Orioles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="5" para="4">That's more than twice the amount Mr. Angelos paid for the franchise in 1993 -- not bad for a team whose attendance has plummeted on his watch.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="5">If baseball officials want to indemnify Mr. Angelos for his anticipated financial losses, that's fine -- but not if the compensation would come at the Nationals' expense.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="5">Yet with negotiations in the eleventh hour, the Orioles' owner has insisted on a prejudicial television broadcasting arrangement that would hold the Nationals' financial fortunes hostage to his own whims indefinitely.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="5">Claiming a highly dubious exclusive right to broadcast all baseball in this region, Mr. Angelos says Nationals games could be shown on his own Orioles regional network; in return for airing its games, he says he would offer the Washington team a ``fair and appropriate fee'' -- but not an equity stake in the network or a percentage of broadcast profits.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="4" para="5">In fact, such a deal is a rip-off that would deflate the Nationals' value and imperil the task of finding a buyer for the franchise -- an orphan that is now the collective property of baseball's 29 team owners.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="5" para="5">What prospective Nationals' owner would cede control of broadcasting rights to a rival -- to say nothing of a rival as truculent as Mr. Angelos?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="6" para="5">Might as well trade away the team's best sluggers and star pitchers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="6">Mr. Angelos has threatened to sue unless he gets his way.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="6">Evidently hoping to avoid the drawn-out, bare-knuckled litigation for which he is notorious, baseball officials have kept negotiations alive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="6">But the talks have gone on for six months, and time's up.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="4" para="6">The season starts next week, and Washington's baseball-starved fans want to tune in.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="5" para="6">Lawyers say Mr. Angelos's legal position is weak.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="6" para="6">It's time for Major League Baseball to fix a sensible broadcasting deal for the Nationals -- whether or not Mr. Angelos will play ball.</sentence>
