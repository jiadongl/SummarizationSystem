Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High Schoola school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.
The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre.
