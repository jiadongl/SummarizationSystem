Three giant pandas living in Beijing Zoo will be sent to Wolong of Sichuan Province, southwest China, Wednesday and three others in Sichuan will fly to Beijing Friday, under an exchange program aimed to maintain the biodiversity of the giant panda population.
On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui  Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda  and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a  local mountain.
