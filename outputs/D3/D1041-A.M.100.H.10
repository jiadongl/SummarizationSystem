More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.
The administration's efforts so far to protect coral reefs include improving monitoring and satellite surveillance, agreeing to Geneva-based treaty restrictions on international trade in coral reefs and passing out $10 million (euro7.4 million) in grants, Lautenbacher said.
