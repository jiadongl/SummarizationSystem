WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court Wednesday wrestled with whether the Constitution allows displays of the Ten Commandments on government property, bringing to a climax the latest battle in the culture war over the role of Christianity in the nation's public life and the exact line between church and state.
The US Supreme Court on Wednesday  was to review the displaying in public spaces of the Ten  Commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of Judeo-Christian  religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of  church and state in American society.
