Indian and Pakistani military  commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan  fired mortar shells across the border into Indian-controlled Kashmir  in violation of a 14-month ceasefire.
The prime ministers of India and Pakistan plan to meet here Wednesday in an effort to find new grounds for compromise in the long-running conflict over Kashmir.
India's prime minister will  personally flag off the first bus to travel between the Indian and  Pakistan zones of divided Kashmir in almost six decades when the  service resumes next month, an official said Saturday.
