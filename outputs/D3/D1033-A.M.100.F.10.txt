South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun  called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence  officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is  now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
MBC TV reported last week that the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's spy agency, secretly recorded a conversation between Hong _ then publisher of the mass-circulation newspaper JoongAng Ilbo _ and Lee Hak-soo, a high-ranking official with the Samsung Group, South Korea's largest business conglomerate.
