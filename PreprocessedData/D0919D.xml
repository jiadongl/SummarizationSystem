		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">In a surprise announcement, Britain's heir to the throne, Prince Charles, declared on Thursday that he will marry his lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">Parker Bowles will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take over the title of princess of Wales that was bestowed on her predecessor, Diana, whose marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly over her.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="3">Diana died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in a Paris car accident.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">Instead, in a sort of constitutional compromise, Parker Bowles, 57, will receive the title her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">If Charles becomes king, she will be called her royal highness the princess consort.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="4">``Those are the only royal titles that have been confirmed so far,'' said a spokesperson for the prince of Wales.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">Britain, which in 1936 forced Charles' great-uncle to abdicate the throne in order to marry an American divorcee, barely batted an eyelash at the consequence of the impending nuptials.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">Prime Minister Tony Blair wished the couple ``every happiness'' on behalf of himself and his Cabinet.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="6">Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who serves as spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, said, ``I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">The announcement came in the form of a brief, formal statement from the prince's household, which read, ``It is with great pleasure that the marriage of HRH the prince of Wales and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles is announced.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="7">It will take place on Friday 8th April, 2005, at Windsor Castle.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">Later, Charles issued a statement that said, ``Mrs. Parker Bowles and I are absolutely delighted.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="8">It will be a very special day for us and our families.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">Queen Elizabeth gave the union her royal blessing.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">``The duke of Edinburgh and I are very happy that the prince of Wales and Mrs. Parker Bowles are to marry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="9">We have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">The 56-year-old prince's two sons, Prince Edward and Prince Harry, announced that they too were delighted at the news of their father's marriage.Although the marriage will cause little political repercussion around Britain, the news dominated the airwaves Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="10">Discussions and surveys showed general acceptance of the marriage but strong reservations about Charles' new wife becoming ``Queen Camilla.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">The memory of Diana, mother of his two sons, is still strong among the British public, for whom Parker Bowles is the spoiler of what began as a fairy-tale marriage.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a onetime nursery school teacher, were wed in 1981.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">Their marriage was made in tabloid heaven, their every move scrutinized and documented in pictures by eager paparazzi.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="12">But it was also marked by widespread speculation about unhappiness and by questions of infidelity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">In 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped call between Charles and Parker Bowles, then the wife of a British brigadier general.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="13">Among the lovers' words was a wish by the prince that he become a tampon in order to remain close to Camilla.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">Charles' relationship with Camilla began about 35 years ago when they met at a polo match on the grounds of Windsor Castle.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="14">They continued seeing each other throughout Charles' tumultuous marriage to Diana, and the relationship was said by Diana to be the cause of her eventual breakup with the prince.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="14">``There were three of us in this marriage -- so it was a bit crowded,'' she said in a famous TV interview.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">(Begin optional trim)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">From the beginning, it was clear Parker Bowles shared Charles' sporting life more than Diana.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="17">Since the early days of his marriage to Diana, Charles was clearly more at home on the back of a horse or shooting grouse and fishing for salmon than on a dance floor, listening to pop music or watching ballet, which were among the favorite pastimes of his young bride.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">Charles and Parker Bowles were often seen fox hunting together or on the polo field, where Charles was a regular player.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="18">Many of their public outings have been on horseback.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Charles and Diana divorced in 1996.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="19">Diana, as princess of Wales, found her calling as a patron of myriad charities, particularly those supporting sick and disadvantaged children and old people.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="19">She championed AIDS victims and traveled to war-torn and poverty stricken countries, visiting orphanages and hospitals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">Her death in a car accident in Paris in August 1997, along with boyfriend Dodi Fayed, provoked an outpouring of grief in Britain and abroad, forcing Charles and Parker Bowles to keep their relationship in the background for some time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">Gradually the couple began appearing together in public in carefully choreographed events.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="22">(End optional trim)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="23">The decision to marry comes as what many see as a logical conclusion to a difficult situation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="24">``I don't think the public is hostile to the remarriage,'' says Sarah Richardson , a constitutional historian at Warwick University.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="24">``What does surprise me is the recognition of her role as princess consort, which will put her in a spotlight where she will have to deliver and be an active supporter of Charles almost on a par with Diana.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="25">Relief rather than pleasure was expressed by many Britons interviewed Thursday by TV networks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="26">``I guess it was better that they got married rather than not,'' said Marianne McElwee, 24, a Web site manager.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="27">``I'm not keen on her,'' McElwee added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="27">``After all, Charles was always in a relationship with her before he met Diana and he went on seeing her after that, which didn't make Diana very happy.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="28">Although the acceptance of a king-to-be, himself divorced, with a divorcee wife, is indicative of the changing face of Britain, the announcement also forces official recognition of the flawed and human side of royalty.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="29">Royal marriages must be approved on several levels, so Blair's statement of approval was essential.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="29">Charles' marriage will also need an Act of Parliament before the wedding day -- virtually a foregone conclusion in this case.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="30">(Optional add end)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="31">The spring wedding will be a civil service followed by a service of prayer and dedication in the chapel of St. George at Windsor Castle.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="31">No details were disclosed Thursday other than that the archbishop had agreed to celebrate the religious ceremony.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="32">The couple will spend their honeymoon in Scotland on the royal estate of Birkhall, where Charles is said often to have taken refuge from the public and media glare.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="33">On Thursday evening, the couple attended a gala dinner at Windsor Castle to support one of Prince Charles's charities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="34">Attention was focused on the prince's bride-to-be wearing her engagement ring for the first time -- a diamond and platinum heirloom reportedly from the prince's grandmother, the queen mother, who was 101 years old when she died in 2002.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="35">The smiling Camilla, dressed in a glittering red floor-length dress and a double string of pearls, told waiting crowds that the prince had proposed to her on bended knee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="35">``I'm just coming down to earth,'' she said, flashing the ring for photographers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="36">Charles, garbed in a tuxedo with a red collar and cuffs, told the assembled reporters, ``I am very happy.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="37">The couple were applauded by their guests and posed, grinning broadly, in front of the press before joining the party.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">They have been friends for 30 years and lovers for most of that time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="1">They have survived marriages to and divorces from other people; the icy disapproval of relatives; the resentment of the public; and, perhaps most excruciating of all, the publication of intimate details of their risque pillow talk.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">But now Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles, whose love affair is said to have begun when she cheekily declared, &quot;My great-grandmother was your great-great-grandfather's mistress, so how about it?,&quot; are to take the most radical and surprising step of their long, star-crossed romance.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="2">They are getting married.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">The wedding is to take place on April 8 in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, Charles announced Thursday, but the 57-year-old bride will not become the Princess of Wales -- that position having already been more than filled by the prince's late and much-remembered ex-wife, Diana.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">Instead, Parker Bowles will be known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">Nor will she be crowned queen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">In a move that addresses one of the thorniest issues surrounding the marriage, Parker Bowles will become the Princess Consort if Charles, 56, succeeds his mother on the throne.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="4">It will be the first time in the history of the English monarchy that such a title has been used, according to Vernon Bogdanor, professor of politics at Oxford University, and the first time an English king's wife has not been queen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="4">(Queen Victoria did have Albert as Prince Consort.)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">The announcement gives official status for the first time to Parker Bowles, who has been living in an uneasy purgatory -- part of the prince's life, but bound by royal custom and social protocol to be an unequal partner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">Although in recent years the two have appeared more often together in public, their murky status has put her in a difficult and oddly anachronistic position.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">In earlier eras, of course, royals were not allowed to marry divorced people (never mind, unless they were Henry VIII, being divorced themselves).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">In 1936, Edward VIII renounced the throne rather than give up Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="6">In 1955, Prince Charles' Aunt, Princess Margaret, broke off a relationship with a divorced man rather than relinquish her royal status and all its perks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">But in a sign of how much things have changed, this time Queen Elizabeth gave her permission for, and blessing to, the engagement of her divorced son to his divorced lover.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">Saying that she and her husband, Charles' father, were &quot;very happy,&quot; she ordered that the Round Tower at Windsor Castle be lit in celebration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">The queen has not always appeared to be Parker Bowles' biggest fan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">Although Charles has for some time been openly living with Camilla, his mother has very rarely entertained the two of them as a couple and indeed seemed intent on distancing herself from the relationship.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="8">But the two met in 2000, and on Thursday the Queen said that &quot;we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">In their own statement, the prince's two sons, Prince Harry and Prince William, said: &quot;We are both very happy for our father and Camilla and we wish them all the luck in the future.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">While the majority of respondents in several snap public opinion polls in Britain on Thursday said they disapproved of the engagement, crowds of well-wishers cheered Prince Charles during a public appearance in London, and politicians rushed to congratulate the couple.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">Even officials of the Church of England, which until 2002 did not even allow divorcees to marry in church, have come around to the idea that Charles and Camilla would be better off married than not.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="11">The question has been complicated by the fact that when he becomes king, Charles will also become supreme governor of the church.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, said he was pleased at Charles and Camilla's decision &quot;to take this important step.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="12">After the civil wedding ceremony, he has agreed to lead a service &quot;of prayer and dedication&quot; at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">In a world of expendable relationships, where middle-aged men trade in middle-aged women for younger, firmer models as easily as they might dispose of a creaky toaster or last year's car, the enduring relationship of Charles and Camilla, as the newspapers call them, carries a sweet poignancy for many.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">Although in recent years she has had something of an image makeover, appearing more in couture dresses and less in frumpy countrywoman garb, Parker Bowles can hardly be called glamorous and does not appear to care.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="14">She once called herself &quot;your devoted old bag&quot; in a love letter to Prince Charles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">Even those unable to forgive Charles for cheating on the late Princess of Wales can take a certain comfort in knowing that if he had to do it, at least he took the counter-intuitive route, choosing someone older, wrinklier and less svelte than his wife, rather than the other way around.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">It has always been clear that, unlike many couples who are actually married, Charles and Camilla truly like each other.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="16">They share a passion for hunting, fishing and other outdoor sports.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="16">They have bawdy senses of humor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="16">More than that, it seems, the fun-loving Camilla is relatively uncomplicated (at least compared with Diana) and has been stolidly supportive of Prince Charles over the years, despite all the angst the relationship has put her through.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="5" para="16">The Prince of Wales and Camilla Shand, as she was then, hit it off from the first time they met, at a polo match in 1970.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="6" para="16">But Charles was something of a playboy, and when he dithered and went abroad to join the Navy, Camilla married a longtime suitor, Andrew Parker Bowles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="7" para="16">The two remained friends with the prince.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="8" para="16">Andrew Parker Bowles even took on the ludicrously named ceremonial post of Silver Stick in Waiting to the prince, while his wife took another traditional role -- that of the prince's mistress.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">Meanwhile, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer, a coltish 19-year-old who captivated the world -- but not her husband -- with her demure good looks and blue-eyed charisma.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="17">The two were spectacularly ill-suited for each other and, sunk by rancor and poor behavior on both sides, the marriage fell part.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">Although Charles later said he took up again with Camilla only when his marriage broke down, Diana claimed that &quot;there were three people in the marriage, so it was quite crowded.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="18">She reportedly called Camilla &quot;the Rottweiler,&quot; while Camilla reportedly referred to her as &quot;that ridiculous creature.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">It was Camilla Charles loved, and when he and Diana divorced in 1996, it seemed that finally the couple could stop sneaking around.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="19">But in the national convulsion of grief following Diana's horrific death from a car accident in Paris in 1997, public opinion turned viciously against Parker Bowles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="19">At one point, irate shoppers pelted her with bread rolls in her local grocery store.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">It was not until 1999, at a party in Piccadilly, that the two even appeared publicly together -- an orchestrated event in which Parker Bowles walked well behind the prince.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">The two were together on Thursday night at a formal dinner in Windsor Palace.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="21">In contrast to his first post-engagement appearance with Diana all those years ago, in which he answered a question about whether he loved her by smirking and saying &quot;whatever love means,&quot; Charles seemed positively ebullient this time around.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="22">Dressed in fuschia and flashing her enormous diamond engagement ring, a royal heirloom, Parker Bowles had the glow of a teenager at the prom.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="22">&quot;I'm just coming down to earth,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">Prince Charles is to marry his partner Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince's office said Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">Clarence House didn't immediately announce further details, but Sky News TV reported that the heir to the throne would marry on April 6.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">Charles was previously married to Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="3">She was divorced from Charles when she died.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">Charles dated Camilla many years before he married Diana in 1981.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="4">They remained friends but Diana blamed Charles' relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also married, for the failure of their union.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">&quot;There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,&quot; Diana said in a 1995 TV interview.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed from his marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriage was &quot;irretrievably broken down, us both having tried.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">The pair divorced in 1996.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">The marriage is a sensitive issue because Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="8">Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England if he took the throne, and some Anglicans remain opposed to remarriage of divorcees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">The church is officially neutral on the issue, but former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey recently urged the couple to marry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marrying Camilla Parker Bowles than oppose it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="10">Thirty-two percent of respondents to the Populus poll said they would support Charles if he remarried, while 29 percent were opposed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="10">Thirty-eight percent said they didn't care and 2 percent had no opinion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">Prince Charles and his longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles _ both divorcees _ will be married in a civil ceremony, not in a Church of England service.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">&quot;The wedding will be a largely private occasion for family and friends.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="2">There will be a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle,&quot; said Clarence House, Charles' residence and office.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="2">&quot;There will subsequently be a service of prayer and dedication in St. George's Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury will preside.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday congratulated Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles after the heir to the throne announced he will marry his long-time partner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">&quot;I'm delighted for the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles,&quot; Blair said in a statement broadcast on British TV.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">&quot;It's very happy news and when the Cabinet heard it this morning they sent their congratulations and good wishes on behalf of the whole government,&quot; the prime minister added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">&quot;We all wish them every happiness for their future together.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, on Thursday welcomed the news that Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are to marry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">&quot;I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step,&quot; said the archbishop, who is the spiritual leader of the Anglican communion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">The communion includes the Church of England, of which Charles is expected to become Supreme Governor when he succeeds Queen Elizabeth II as British monarch.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">&quot;I hope and pray that it will prove a source of comfort and strength to them and to those who are closest to them,&quot; Williams said in a statement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">Charles announced he would marry Camilla in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle on April 8.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">Charles and Camilla are both divorcees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">Williams said he approved of the proposals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">&quot;These arrangements have my strong support and are consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage which the Prince of Wales fully accepts as a committed Anglican and as prospective Supreme Governor of the Church of England,&quot; Williams said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">Prince Charles said Thursday he is &quot;very excited&quot; about his engagement to his longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">After his office surprised Britain by announcing that the couple will be married at Windsor Castle on April 8, the prince was congratulated during a regularly scheduled visit to London's financial district.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">&quot;Thank you very much, you're so kind.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="3">he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="3">&quot;I am very excited.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">Prince Charles' sons William and Harry are &quot;delighted&quot; at news he will marry Camilla Parker Bowles, a spokesman for the heir to the throne's office said Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">Prince William and Prince Harry, Charles' sons with the late Princess Diana, are said to want the couple to be happy, the spokesman for Clarence House said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">Charles and his future wife will attend a dinner at Windsor Castle later Thursday, a spokeswoman for Clarence House added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="4">Parker Bowles will wear her engagement ring, she added, but she gave no details of the ornament.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="1">Many Britons welcomed Prince Charles' surprise announcement that he would marry his lover Camilla Parker Bowles, but some said she never will win their hearts the way Princess Diana did.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="2">Within minutes of Charles' announcement that the couple will marry at Windsor Castle on April 8, it was hard to find anyone on the streets of central London who hadn't heard the news.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="3">&quot;We've all been expecting that sooner or later, said Dina Pine, 73, a retired restaurant owner.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="3">&quot;But I don't think she should be queen.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="4">&quot;I'm fine with him marrying her.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="4">They seem to suit each other,&quot; said Bonita Archibald, 39, a hairdresser.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="5">Archibald said Prince Charles should be given the benefit of the doubt in such decisions, even though he has been known for occasional gaffes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="2" para="5">&quot;Charles seems to have his head screwed on,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="6">Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and other well-known British public figures, said it's time for the public to forget about royal tragedies of the past and welcome Camilla into the fold.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="9">&quot;They are clearly very much in love.</sentence>
