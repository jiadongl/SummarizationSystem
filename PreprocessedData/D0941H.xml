		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Scientists have long thought thick clouds over Saturn's moon Titan rained methane through smoggy skies.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="1">Some believed the liquid pooled on the planet's surface, perhaps forming lakes or seas reminiscent of Earth's.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Recent images of the moon -- about half the size of Earth -- show dark regions next to a light one.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="2">Researchers, however, haven't been able to figure out which is higher in elevation, let alone what they're made of.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">Space scientists hope to finally get some answers in three weeks when they send a space probe spinning down through the thick atmosphere of a world more distant than any visited before.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">Friday holds a pivotal moment for Cassini, partly built in and partly controlled from Colorado and estimated to cost the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency $3.3 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">Launched in 1997 and expected to collect pictures and data until at least 2008, the spacecraft will fly 45 times by Titan, the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="4">Many scientists suspect the moon has its own weather, as well as chemical cycles similar to those on Earth, and can even help researchers understand how life originated here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">From what scientists can tell, the chemical composition of Titan's atmosphere reflects what was on Earth several billion years ago, when life was just getting started, said Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging leader and a researcher with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">&quot;(Titan) doesn't have liquid water, because it's too cold ... but chemical processes that are happening slowly there might be similar to what happened on Earth,&quot; Porco said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">&quot;This will be like a Jules Verne adventure,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="7">&quot;Maybe we'll see cliffs and cracks, maybe we'll see meandering streams and valleys.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="7">Or maybe we won't.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">Sometime after 8 p.m. Friday, Cassini researchers scattered around the world will watch as the landing probe Huygens separates from the spacecraft and heads toward the moon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">If separation is successful, Huygens will spend three more weeks sinking slowly toward Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="9">On Jan. 14, it will float through the atmosphere on parachutes, shooting pictures for 2 1/2 hours before it hits the surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">Larry Esposito, a University of Colorado planetary scientist, said he's &quot;just burning with curiosity&quot; to see what's captured by the probe's cameras, which were built by Lockheed Martin engineers in Jefferson County.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">&quot;I'm guessing it'll look a little like a bad day of skiing at Vail, when all the snow is dirty and hummocked, it's slushy and muddy, ... (and) maybe there's water underneath,&quot; Esposito said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">Huygens, which can float, is designed to hit the planet's surface at less than 20 mph, he said, and it may be able to send pictures for a half hour from the ground, a lake or whatever else it encounters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">Lockheed Martin engineer Chuck Rasbach helped design one of the Huygens cameras, which he called &quot;rugged, robust and compact.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">The camera has been tested every six months on the seven-year journey to Saturn, he said, and appears to be functioning well.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">Rasbach said he's proud to be part of the Cassini team, although the mission isn't likely to have practical outcomes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">&quot;I wouldn't mind designing telephones, because it's practical, you use a telephone every day,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="16">&quot;With space, well, ... it moves humanity forward.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">An instrumented space-faring emissary called Huygens will separate Friday night from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn and begin a three-week descent of nearly 2 million miles to the planet's weird moon Titan to sample its atmosphere and its puzzling surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">The risky mission, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, will mark the space era's first attempt to explore any planetary moon in the solar system since the six historic Apollo landings on Earth's own satellite more than 30 years ago.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">Giant Titan, 3,200 miles in diameter, is the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere all its own -- a dense one that has intrigued earthbound astronomers for decades.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">Mission engineers have programmed the adventure to begin precisely at 7:08 PST Friday night, when three tiny pyrotechnic explosives on Cassini's exterior must sever three tiny bolts simultaneously and release three tightly compressed springs in order to propel the 705-pound, wok-shaped Huygens probe away from its mother ship and send it on its long free fall through empty space to the mystery moon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">The springs are designed to give Huygens (pronounced HOY-ginz) &quot;a good spin&quot; -- seven revolutions per minute -- and thrust it into the void, first at less than 1 mph, but then quickly to a speed relative to orbiting Cassini of about 13,500 mph, according to deputy mission operations manager Earl Maize at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">&quot;We tested and tested the system again and again long ago because releasing those springs simultaneously is critically important, and we're confident it's ready,&quot; Maize said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">&quot;We don't think there's any chance that Huygens will miss Titan, and we've factored in everything we know of the winds that might deflect the probe on its way through Titan's atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="6">It looks as though it will land within a few tens of meters of its planned landing site.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">If the engineers have aimed correctly, Huygens will first reach the giant moon's dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere and then its surface on Jan. 14 -- to radio back what its six instruments find there, hopefully for as long as two hours.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">Just what the probe will encounter -- a landing site marked by hard-frozen ice, lakes of liquid tar, ancient craters drowned in oozing chemical slush, or volcanoes spouting organic ices -- remains unknown to astronomers waiting all over the world.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">At least as intriguing as the nature of the moon's surface is the precise composition of Titan's smoggy, 12-layered atmosphere, which many believe may closely resemble the mix of gases that early Earth possessed -- rich in the organic chemicals essential for life to emerge and evolve.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">With Cassini moving on its regular programmed orbit around Saturn this week, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory signaled the spacecraft Tuesday to perform its eighth and final &quot;orbit deflection maneuver,&quot; altering its flight path slightly and putting it on a direct collision course for Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">The mission controllers also started timers on Cassini to set the precise moment at which the Huygens probe will be released from the orbiter and sent on its own ballistic trajectory -- with no ability to steer itself -- toward the planned landing site.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">The location is marked by what Cassini's cameras have seen as interlocking light and dark areas, which may be plateaus next to mountain spires or low-lying solids or even liquids.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">&quot;It all looks good, and we've a green light to proceed,&quot; said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens probe's chief scientist and mission manager in an interview during the recent San Francisco meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">Despite the mission's unprecedented audacity and technical complexity, the teams of scientists and engineers are confident that Huygens will reach its target and perform its tasks of analyzing the atmosphere and the surface at its landing site.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">If all goes well, Cassini will signal within seconds of its programmed release sequence that the launch of Huygens has been successful.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="15">But that message -- traveling at the speed of light -- will take one hour, seven minutes and 39 seconds to reach the eager scientists and engineers at JPL and the European Space Agency's control center in Darmstadt, Germany.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">Then, as the Huygens probe falls toward the top of Titan's perceptible atmosphere, 789 miles above the surface, its two transmitters, each with its own antenna, will signal its progress to Cassini, and the orbiter will record the messages for later transmission to Earth.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">After Huygens has arrived at its target, mission engineers will alter Cassini's course once again so it is no longer on its collision course toward Titan and return it to its regular orbit around Saturn and its schedule of 45 more sweeping observation flights past the intriguing moon over the next four years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">Cassini, with the Huygens probe riding piggy-back, was launched from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan 4-B rocket on Oct. 15, 1997.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="18">It flew twice past Venus, once past Earth and once past Jupiter and traveled a total of 2.2 billion miles before passing through Saturn's rings and swinging into its first orbit around the planet on July 1.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">The European Space Agency built and managed the development of Huygens and directs the probe's operations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="19">The Italian Space Agency provided Cassini's high-gain antenna, much of its radio system and crucial parts for several of Cassini's science instruments.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">The probe was named after Christiaan Huygens, the 17th century Dutch mathematician and physicist who discovered Titan in 1655 and examined Saturn's rings in great detail.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">The planned cost of the entire joint mission is $3.2 billion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="21">That includes the roughly $500 million cost of the Huygens probe, which is being borne by many of the European Space Agency's members.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">With a gentle shove on Christmas Eve, the Cassini spacecraft will launch the European Space Agency's Huygens probe on a course that should send it plunging into the atmosphere of Saturn's big moon Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">The probe must be released precisely on course because it has no means of maneuvering and will remain dormant until a timer wakes it up for entry into Titan's hazy, hydrocarbon-laced atmosphere and a parachute descent to the surface on Jan. 14.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">Confirmation of a successful release should be received by NASA's Deep Space Network antennas in Spain and Goldstone, California, just before 0400 GMT Saturday (11 p.m. EST Friday), Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">The $3.3 billion (euro2.45 billion) Cassini-Huygens mission, a project of NASA, ESA and the Italian space agency, was launched on Oct. 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to study Saturn, its spectacular rings and many moons.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">During the nearly seven years Cassini took to reach the ringed planet, the attached probe was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in June and has made several passes by Titan in preparation for the probe's release.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">Friday evening, tension-loaded springs will push Huygens away from Cassini on a free-fall toward Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">On Monday, Cassini will perform a course change to avoid following the probe into Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">Huygens is designed to make a 2 1/2-hour descent by parachute to the surface of the moon, which, according to some theories, could have lakes of methane.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">Instruments aboard the probe will investigate the atmosphere's chemistry and cameras will try to record images of the surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="10">It's not known whether Huygens will drop into liquid or onto a hard surface, where it may operate for a few minutes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">As long as it is operating, Huygens will be transmitting data back to Cassini, which will later turn around to point its antenna at Earth and send the data to the Deep Space Network and on to ESA's Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">After a seven-year journey, a saucer-shaped probe prepared Friday night to detach itself from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn to dive toward one of the most mysterious bodies in the solar system: the giant moon Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">If successful, the Huygens probe will be the first spacecraft to visit Titan, whose dense atmosphere and apparent soup of organic chemicals have led scientists to compare it to conditions on a young Earth, just before life began.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">Though astronomers have spent decades examining Titan from Earth and space, even basic facts about the moon remain unknown.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="3">It is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, but scientists can only guess what kind of surface will greet Huygens -- a sea of liquid methane, ice, or a strange hydrocarbon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">&quot;It is bizarre, with so much scrutiny for so much time, Titan is almost (more) mysterious now than when we started this project,&quot; said John Zarnecki, a lead investigator for the Huygens mission of The Open University in England.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="4">&quot;The whole thing is pretty crazy.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">Huygens's suicide plunge is the most dramatic moment planned for the four years the spacecraft Cassini will spend circling the planet and its 31 known moons.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="5">Cassini, which arrived in Saturn's orbit earlier this year, has already discovered several moons and has sent back some of the most detailed pictures of Saturn's elaborate rings.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">After it detaches from Cassini, the 9-foot Huygens probe will fall toward Titan and, if all goes as planned, enter the moon's opaque atmosphere Jan. 14.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="6">The sturdy probe will have to endure temperatures of about 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit from atmospheric friction during its entry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="6">Three parachutes will deploy, allowing the probe, which is designed primarily to study the atmosphere, to spend 2 1/2 hours measuring temperature, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric composition, all while snapping more than 1,100 pictures.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="4" para="6">Its time in the spotlight will be short-lived, however -- when and if it lands, Huygens will have at most only two more hours on the surface before Cassini moves out of contact and Huygens loses touch with Earth.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">These are tense times for NASA and the 16 European nations involved in the $3.27 billion Cassini-Huygens project, named for two 17th-century astronomers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">Some scientists, such as Zarnecki, have been working on the project for more than 15 years -- and are unlikely to have another chance for a direct visit to such a distant body.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">The mission follows a tumultuous two years at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, during which occurred the Columbia shuttle tragedy, a successful robotic landing on Mars, and, more recently, a largely failed attempt to bring back solar particles from space.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">The elaborate and expensive Cassini-Huygens project, launched in 1997, is a dramatic departure from NASA's recent mantra of &quot;faster, better, cheaper,&quot; and, if successful, will probably serve as a model for more ambitious exploration projects.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">Cassini's findings from Saturn itself may help scientists better understand the origin of the solar system, but it is on Titan where they hope to find more specific clues to the origin of life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="10">Previous observations have suggested that the moon has a hazy atmosphere of organic matter and a possibly rich top layer filled with carbon-based compounds of the kind that were on Earth at the time when life is thought to have arisen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="10">Earth's biological and geological processes have erased the evidence from those early years, so scientists' best hope is to analyze similar conditions on another planetary body, such as Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="4" para="10">The moon's frigid temperatures -- estimated to be around minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit -- make Titan an inhospitable environment for life, but may have helped preserve concentrations of organic matter similar to those on Earth before life began.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">One of the great mysteries of the Huygens visit will be what kind of landscape greets the probe.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="11">Some scientists have speculated that organic material in Titan's atmosphere drifts to the surface and then returns to the air, much as oceans send water vapor into the Earth's atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="11">Zarnecki, who designed the probe's surface scientific instruments, says he hopes to find a deep sea of liquid methane and ethane.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">&quot;It could be the first time we've done oceanography somewhere else,&quot; said Zarnecki.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">If there is wind, some astronomers say, Titan's relatively weak gravity could mean waves could reach hundreds of feet high, slowly moving across its surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="13">Scientists have not seen any meteorite craters on the surface but suspect they could exist, buried under a lake or a gooey mixture of organic matter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">&quot;We don't know yet,&quot; said Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona, a planetary scientist working on the mission.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="14">Recent pictures of Titan taken by the Cassini orbiter seem to suggest Huygens may land on a solid surface, but scientists say they will not know until they get there.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="14">In addition to climate history, Lunine says he wants to study &quot;simple nonbiological chemistry&quot; there in hopes of understanding how nonliving compounds could make the transition to life.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">Zarnecki and other scientists have equipped the 700-pound stationary probe well: Huygens can measure its tilt to figure out if it lands on solid or liquid.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="15">The probe could probably float on a methane lake and has sonar that may be able to measure depth if it lands on liquid, or even the distance to nearby rocks to measure the terrain if it lands on solid ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">Whatever it does will have to happen quickly: If Huygens lands successfully, probably somewhere near Titan's equator, it will have no more than two hours to study the moon's surface before its only link to Earth -- Cassini -- disappears over the horizon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">By the time the orbiter comes around again weeks later, Huygens's batteries will be frozen solid.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="17">Beth Daley can be reached by e-mail at bdaleyglobe.com.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mothership late Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, during which it will sample the atmosphere of Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">NASA said in an online news release that its Deep Space Network tracking stations in Madrid, Spain and Goldstone, California, received the signal at about 10:24 p.m. EST (0324 GMT).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">Titan is the only moon that has an atmosphere in the Solar system.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="3">Its chemistry is believed to be very similar to that of early Earth before life formed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="3">And scientists hope the on-site probe by Huygens would confirm the assumption and help them to better understand how life appears on Earth.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">The European-made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official said on Saturday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">&quot;The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter,&quot; Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="2">&quot;They received the signal, I think at 7:24 (0324 GMT) this evening.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan, the only moon in the solar system which has an atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="3">It is scheduled to arrive at its destination on January 14.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">At launch time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away from Cassini onto a ballistic four-million-kilometer (about 2.5-million-mile) path toward Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, after which the probe will begin sending data back to Earth.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">The Frisbee-shaped Huygens probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft Friday and began a risky 2.5-million-mile journey to the surface of Saturn's bizarre, smog-choked moon Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">Applause burst out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory shortly after 7:24 p.m. PST, when scientists received word from NASA's Deep Space Network tracking stations in Spain and Goldstone, Calif., that the Huygens probe had cast off after a seven-year piggyback ride on the Cassini spacecraft.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="2">All systems were said to have performed flawlessly in the separation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">``Today's release was another successful milestone in the Cassini-Huygens odyssey,'' said David Southwood of the European Space Agency, which built the Huygens probe.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="3">``Now all of our hopes and expectations are focused on getting the first (close-up) data from a new world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">That data won't come for another three weeks, during which time the 9-foot-diameter Huygens probe will chase down Titan and then, if everything goes as planned, hurl itself through the thick, nitrogen-methane atmosphere before crashing into a surface that could consist of anything from a sticky chemical sludge to poison oceans.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="5">Titan has beguiled scientists for years because it is unlike any other place in the solar system.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="5">The only moon with an atmosphere, Titan is also of interest because it is thought to resemble the early Earth, before plant life formed and began pumping oxygen into the atmosphere.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="6">Too frigid at minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit to grow life itself, Titan is a kind of frozen museum piece of what an early, Earth-like planet might look like.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="7">The $3.2-billion Cassini mission is a cooperative venture between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="7">The largest and most ambitious interplanetary probe ever launched, the 6-ton spacecraft lifted off Oct. 15, 1997.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="7">The mission involved 260 scientists from 17 nations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="8">Cassini reached Saturn in July, the first part of a two-part scientific exploration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="8">Cassini first used its array of imaging devices to take detailed pictures as it flew through the planet's spectacular rings and swung past chilled and broken moons.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="9">In late October, Cassini passed within 745 miles of the surface of Titan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="9">Though the spacecraft's cameras were able to penetrate the haze in places, the images beamed back to earth only whetted scientists' appetites for the second part of the mission, Huygens' dramatic plunge.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">``Have we seen some craters?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="10">Perhaps.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="10">Some kind of flow on the surface?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="4" para="10">Perhaps.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="5" para="10">Vulcanism?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="6" para="10">Perhaps,'' said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens project manager for the European Space Agency.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">Answering those questions is the job of Huygens, a 700-pound collection of scientific instruments designed to sniff and measure the atmosphere of Titan as it streaks to the surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="11">Although they are intrigued by images Cassini took in October of what looks to be an irregular land mass dubbed Xanadu, scientists said Friday that they had no fixed idea where the probe would land.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="3" para="11">Titan's strong winds could blow it hundreds of miles across the surface.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="12">Scientists are hoping the probe survives its landing long enough to send back information about the surface of the moon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="1">The international Cassini spacecraft launched a probe on a three-week free-fall toward Saturn's mysterious moon Titan, where it will plunge into the hazy atmosphere and descend by parachute while its science instruments and cameras make observations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="2">The European Space Agency's Huygens probe is equipped with instruments to sample the chemistry of the planet-size moon's thick atmosphere, and may reveal whether it actually has lakes or seas of liquid methane and ethane that have been theorized by scientists.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">A signal confirming release of the probe was received at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at 7:24 p.m. PST (0324 GMT Saturday).</sentence>
