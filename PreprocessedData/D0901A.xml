		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Markets are overcrowded, traffic jam is heavy and the shops are jostling with shoppers in the capital city of Srinagar in the Indian-administered Kashmir as the holy Moslem festival of Eid approaches here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Kashmiris are known as incorrigible festive shoppers and because of that reputation, unscrupulous shopkeepers have been minting money by over-charging the locals for everything from a chop of mutton to the chickens and hosiery items that the locals must buy to protect themselves from the biting cold of the winter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">But, around this Eid festival, there is more to the happy public mood than just the urge to over spend during the festival.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who arrives here on a two- day visit next week, announced on Thursday that orders had been given for the reduction of troops inside Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">This measure has obviously been taken to take care of the building tensions between the Indian army and local people who often come into unpleasant contact during encounters, crackdown operations and search and cordon exercises that have become so routine in Kashmir ever since the present armed struggle against the Indian rule started here 18 years back.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">It must also be mentioned that the Indian army on Friday suspended and took into custody an officer who had been accused of having raped a woman and her daughter in a north Kashmir village last week.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="7">It is, therefore, clear that the Prime Minister's decision has not been influenced by any dramatic improvement in the ground situation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="8">Coinciding with the announcement made in the Indian capital New Delhi, Indian paramilitary police was battling it out with two suicide guerrillas that forced entry into their camp in Srinagar' s Dalgate area on the banks of the Dal lake that is regarded as one of the most secured places in Kashmir and the hub of the tourist activity in Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="9">Interestingly, Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil, who had recently visited Kashmir for three-days, told reporters in Delhi that he was yet to submit his report to the Prime Minister about his perceptions of the ground situation in Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="10">Patil was obviously trying to suggest that the Prime Minister Singh had taken the decision to reduce the troops inside Kashmir on his own.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">Kashmir is a very tricky situation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="11">One grenade blast can put things back by months here.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="11">That is why the prime minister has said that together with the reduction in the number of troops in Kashmir, there would be no lowering of vigil.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">This also is the reason that many locals believe the Indian government is acting under international pressure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">Interestingly, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had recently put forth a new formula on Kashmir that was seen as a climb down from the previous Pakistan position on Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="12">Significantly, Musharraf had suggested withdrawal of Indian troops from Kashmir region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="13">Does this mean that both Musharraf and Singh are simply trying to play roles that have been scripted for them by the international community?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">For most Kashmiris who have been fed up with the stiffening of Indian and Pakistan approaches on Kashmir, this appears to be the right argument.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="14">And that has given them new hope to celebrate the forthcoming Eid with more joy and confidence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">It is possible the solution ahs already been drafted and both India and Pakistan are slowly but surely moving in that direction step by step so that the people of the two countries are not taken by surprise when the final agreement is signed, said Samad Sheikh, 71, a village headman in Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">For Kashmiris the recent developments and the fact that the bilateral ceasefire on the borders between the two countries was holding for the last one year are indications that their troubles might soon end.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Crying, waving and throwing letters wrapped around stones to each other, hundreds of Kashmiris gathered on either side of a river that separates the disputed Himalayan region between Pakistan and India.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">The emotional reunion Wednesday across the Neelum River came on the final day of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr _ and as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paid a rare visit to Indian-controlled Kashmir, his country's only Muslim-majority state.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">Families separated for decades by the Kashmir conflict shouted greetings over the noise of the fast-flowing river.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">Despite easing tensions between South Asia's nuclear rivals, Kashmiris are still forbidden from crossing the watery border.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">Nosheen Akhtar, 22, and her mother, Khonshad Begum, 40, burst into tears, wailed and beat their chests _ unable to meet Begum's mother on the Indian side.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">&quot;I want to jump into the river.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">My mother is there and I cannot go over to meet with her,&quot; said Begum, her relatives holding her back.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">Authorities on both sides were restricting access to the riverside at Karin, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-held Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="6">Indian soldiers were preventing people from getting too close, and on the Pakistan side, police said authorities had not given formal permission for the reunions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">The Pakistani and Indian portions of Kashmir are separated by a heavily militarized cease-fire line where skirmishes were once common between their forces.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">The guns have fallen silent for the past year amid the thaw in relations, and since then there have been several opportunities for family reunions _ albeit at a distance of 25 meters (yards) across the river.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in its entirety and have fought two wars over it since their independence from British rule in 1947.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="8">The conflict has only deepened since an Islamic insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="8">India accuses Pakistan of helping foment it, which Pakistan denies.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="8">Some Kashmiris have fled from the Indian to the Pakistan side, accused of involvement with the rebels.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">On Wednesday, Singh, the Indian leader, expressed a commitment to make peace with Pakistan, while Islamabad hailed India's withdrawal of some of India's troops in Kashmir _ a move hoped to spur the peace process.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">But Kashmiris are impatient for progress that will allow them to reunite with relatives across the cease-fire line, known as the Line of Control.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">The two countries are due to start formal talks on Kashmir next month, and people on both sides are eager for a long-standing proposal for a bus service between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-held Kashmir, to finally get off the ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">&quot;Both the countries have not been allowing us to meet,&quot; said Raja Azhar Khan, a 55-year-old refugee, whose wife and son live on the Indian side of the Neelum River.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">&quot;The two countries are getting friendly.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="13">They are allowing people to meet each other at Wagha (the main land border between Indian and Pakistan).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="13">Why are we Kashmiris not being allowed to meet?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">The leader of moderate Kashmiri separatists warned Thursday that lasting peace between India and Pakistan would be impossible unless his people were seated at the negotiating table.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">During more than a year of talks with Pakistan, India has refused to let Kashmiri leaders have a direct role in deciding possible solutions to the 57-year conflict over Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Omar Farooq insisted Thursday that ``historic realities,'' such as a guerrilla war against Indian rule that began in 1989, meant three-way talks were the only way to end the dispute over the divided territory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">``Kashmiris have expressed themselves in red-hot blood for the last 15 years, and this reality cannot be ignored, neither by India nor Pakistan,'' said Farooq, who heads a loose alliance of separatist groups called the All Party Hurriyat Conference.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">``So if anybody believes that you can have a bilateral agreement on Kashmir, they are highly mistaken.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">The official death toll in the Kashmir insurgency is more than 45,000, but Kashmiris say the real number is more than twice that.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">Almost 1,600 people have died in the conflict this year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="7">Indian authorities said about half the dead were militants, 456 were civilians and 269 were members of the security forces.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">In January, former Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's government began the first talks with Kashmiri separatist leaders, but two rounds of discussions showed little progress.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been slow to resume negotiations with Kashmiri leaders since defeating Vajpayee in May elections.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">Singh repeated here Wednesday that Kashmir is part of India and insisted any peace deal with Pakistan could not redraw international borders or divide Indian territory along religious lines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="10">Kashmiri leaders feared those were new condset out specific proposals for negotiation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">A third round of talks with India's government can't start until it agrees to let Kashmiri leaders visit Pakistan to discuss peace proposals with its government and guerrilla commanders in the part of Kashmir under Pakistan's control, Farooq said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">``Both things have to be addressed,'' he told reporters here, after insisting Hurriyat leaders were not setting conditions for resuming negotiations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="13">Farooq said Hurriyat leaders would travel to New Delhi next week to meet Pakistan's Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who is expected to discuss new efforts to advance a peace process that began last year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="14">According to Farooq, Aziz plans to discuss recent proposals by President Pervez Musharraf for a settlement, which included granting autonomy to the divided region and putting parts of it under joint rule by India and Pakistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="15">After hearing Kashmiri leaders' views, Aziz will formally present the proposals to India's government, said Farooq, who called Musharraf's suggestions ``a step in the right direction.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="16">``The Hurriyat has three road maps for resolving the Kashmir issue,'' Farooq said, without providing details.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="16">``And we are ready to discuss all three, with both the Indian and Pakistan governments, so that a way forward can be charted that is acceptable to all.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with Kashmiri political leaders on Thursday during a rare visit to the Himalayan region aimed at ending half a century of separatist violence that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Earlier, Singh offered to hold talks on Kashmir &quot;with anyone and everyone&quot; but ruled out any redrawing of the disputed territory's frontier, which separates Indian- and Pakistan-controlled portions of the region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">Singh _ on his first visit as prime minister to India's Jammu-Kashmir state _ also announced a four-year, multibillion-dollar development plan he promised would result in thousands of jobs for people in the region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">Singh's two-day trip came as India began withdrawing some of its troops on the border, a goodwill gesture to war-weary Kashmiris and rival Pakistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">On Thursday, Singh met with members of the state Cabinet to discuss ways to implement the economic aid package.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">He was also scheduled to meet with army and paramilitary force commanders to review a decision to reduce troops deployed in India's Jammu-Kashmir state.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">Although Singh's visit was largely welcomed by Kashmiris, many were inconvenienced after security forces barricaded the main streets of Jammu, the state's winter capital, ahead of his arrival.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="7">Children and office workers trudged to their schools and offices after public buses were halted as part of the stringent security measures in the city.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="8">India accuses Pakistan of arming Muslim insurgents fighting for the region's independence or merger with Islamic Pakistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="3" para="8">Islamabad denies that.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">Talks with Kashmiri separatists began last year under Singh's predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="9">Singh indicated his government also would press to end tensions with Kashmiri militants and Pakistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">But Singh shrugged off a suggestion by Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf last month that some areas of Kashmir be made independent, placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or put under United Nations administration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">&quot;Any redrawing of the international borders is not something that is going to be acceptable to us,&quot; Singh said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">Singh also Wednesday addressed a rally of some 12,000 people.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">&quot;I have come here with the realization and hope that I can understand what your aspirations and desires are,&quot; he said, barely visible as he spoke from behind a bulletproof screen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">India has cited a decline in separatist violence as the main reason for its troop withdrawal, which reportedly will be about 40,000 of the half-million stationed in Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">But a gunbattle launched by militants hours before Singh's visit underscored the fragile security of the region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="15">Two militants were killed and two soldiers and a civilian wounded in the attack near the rally site, security forces said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">Singh announced an economic development plan for Kashmir that would spend 71 billion rupees (US$1.5 billion, euro1.16 billion) next year, part of a 240 billion rupee (US$5.3 billion, euro4.1 billion) outlay over four years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="16">Some of the money will come from international financial institutions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">The funds would go to building new roads and schools, and developing infrastructure for water, power and health care.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="17">The initiatives are expected to create 24,000 new jobs, including 14,000 for women.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">Creating employment for young people in Jammu-Kashmir was also a priority, Singh said, adding a ban on recruitment for government jobs will be lifted.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="18">The countrywide ban on government hiring was part of measures to downsize India's bloated public sector.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="19">&quot;The ban will not apply to Jammu-Kashmir since youth in the state are facing hardships in getting jobs,&quot; Singh told a crowd of about 15,000 in Jammu.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">Pakistan says it would not accept the existing military line dividing Kashmir as an international border, and is playing down concern that India is irreconcilibly opposed to adjusting that frontier.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">During a rare visit to the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered Wednesday to hold talks on Kashmir &quot;with anyone and everyone,&quot; but ruled out any redrawing of the Himalayan territory's frontier.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said that Singh's comments did not necessarily represent an intractable position.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">&quot;Let us not read too much into these statements because, as you can see, we have this track of confidence-building and dialogue, and there is no definitiveness in these statements,&quot; Khan told a news conference Thursday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">Singh's trip to Kashmir came as India began withdrawing some of its troops from the region, a goodwill gesture to war-weary Kashmiris and Pakistan ahead of planned talks between the nuclear armed rivals on the problem due next month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, and the countries have fought two wars between over the territory since 1947.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="6">The Indian- and Pakistan-controlled portions are separated by the so-called Line of Control.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">&quot;Any solution based on the Line of Control will not be acceptable to Pakistan,&quot; Khan said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="7">&quot;This is very clear.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="7">We are asking for a solution that is acceptable to the people of Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">Pakistan and India began a peace process early this year, and are due to start formal talks on Kashmir next month.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">In a shift in stance, Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf last month suggested that some areas of Kashmir be made independent, placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or put under United Nations administration.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">The proposals have been greeted with little enthusiasm by India, although it has since announced its troop withdrawal.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="11">On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Kasuri advised India to avoid controversial statements, saying the relations between the two nations were at a &quot;very delicate stage and required careful nurturing.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="12">&quot;The fact is that Jammu and Kashmir is a dispute which Pakistan and India have to resolve through dialogue and negotiations,&quot; he was quoted as saying by state-run news agency the Associated Press of Pakistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="13">Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is due to make his first trip to India next week since taking office in August, and will hold talks with Singh.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="13">Khan said the two prime ministers would discuss &quot;all issues.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">The prime ministers of India and Pakistan plan to meet here Wednesday in an effort to find new grounds for compromise in the long-running conflict over Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz arrived here Tuesday on a tour of regional capitals as head of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which promotes closer economic ties within the region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">Aziz has said he will use his visit with Indian leaders to seek progress in peace efforts that began last year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">Both countries have hinted that Aziz's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may produce agreement on opening bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir for the first time in 57 years of conflict over the Himalayan territory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">The two countries also are said to be near a deal on a $4.2 billion pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to India through Pakistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">Aziz's two-day visit comes amid mixed signals from India and Pakistan on their willingness to compromise on Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="6">After insisting for months that they were ready to give up entrenched positions and make lasting peace, leaders of both countries in recent days have repeated hard-line views on the disputed region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">Indian security forces said they were winning a war against the separatists in Kashmir, which began in 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="7">Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf insisted again last week that the guerrillas were freedom fighters acting without anything but moral support from his country.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">The Indian military says so far this year it has blocked about 60 attempts by militants to infiltrate Indian-held territory from the Pakistani side.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="8">The number climbed in recent weeks as Musharraf pressed Singh to move more quickly on negotiations over Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">``Let me tell you that I have no reason to believe that there has been any lack of effort in infiltration attempts from across the border,'' India's chief of army staff, Gen. Nirmal Chander Vij, said Monday.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the United States pressured Pakistan to rein in the militant groups, several of which were allies of the al-Qaida network.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="10">But as the guerrillas lose their strength, Pakistan loses leverage on the Kashmir issue.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">India tightened the noose around the insurgents by completing a 12-foot-high fence this year that runs 340 miles along its international border with Pakistan and a 1972 cease-fire line, or Line of Control, that divides the disputed region between the two.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">When the British pulled out of the subcontinent in August 1947, they told the Indian princes, including the Hindu maharajah who ruled the mainly Muslim territory of Jammu and Kashmir, to choose between joining India or Pakistan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="13">As the king delayed, the two neighboring nations went to war over the region in October of that year, and it has been divided since.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">Within days of the war, the maharajah chose India, but Pakistan has long insisted that he did so under pressure and that the people of Kashmir should be allowed to decide their fate in a binding referendum promised in a 1948 United Nations Security Council resolution.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="15">(End optional trim)</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="16">Musharraf is the first Pakistani leader to publicly suggest that the dispute might be resolved without a vote by Kashmiris -- if India makes significant concessions.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="16">But he also has suggested that India is hardening its position.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="17">Last week, Musharraf revived Pakistan's demand for the plebiscite, in the face of New Delhi's continued claim that Kashmir was its territory and that India's boundaries could not be redrawn.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="5">On Wednesday, Islamabad denied it had violated the ceasefire in  the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, spark of two of three wars  between Indian and Pakistan, and over which they skirmished in  2002.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="6">India and Pakistan began the ceasefire November 25, 2003, after  routinely exchanging artillery fire across the volatile Line of  Control, the de facto border separating their armies in Kashmir, as  part of a tentative peace process.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="5">India and Pakistan agreed last month that Kashmiri residents  would not need passports to cross the divided state by bus but would  use permits issued by the civil administration after being cleared  by police.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="6">The bus service was suspended in 1947 after the first  India-Pakistan war over Kashmir.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="2" para="6">The second was in 1965.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="7">Indian Kashmir is in the grip of a 15-year-old insurgency that  has so far left thousands dead.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="8">India blames Pakistan for fomenting the insurgency in Kashmir  which has left at least 40,000 dead according Indian estimates,  though separatists put the toll at twice that number.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="9">Pakistan denies supporting the rebels though it admits to  extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris'  freedom struggle.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="10">Indian authorities last week said some 150 permits had been  issued to applicants from Indian-Kashmir to travel by the bus  linking Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, capital of the  Pakistan-administered zone.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="11">Of the 150 applicants, 60 will be short-listed for the first two  trips -- the first on April 7 and the second a fortnight later -- an  official said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="1">Pakistani and Indian officials will exchange passenger lists for a bus service next month across the divided Kashmir region, a Foreign Ministry official said Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="2">Pakistan and India agreed in February to re-establish a bus link between the Indian- and Pakistan-controlled portions of Kashmir as part of moves to improve relations between the two longtime rivals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="3">The first buses between Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, and Srinagar, capital of Indian Kashmir, are scheduled to run on April 7 _ one bus with 30 passengers traveling in each direction.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="4">Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani said Pakistani and Indian officials will on Tuesday exchange lists of passengers for the first buses.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="5">The passengers on the first bus route will include men and women, as well as elderly people who have not seen relatives on the other side of the frontier for 50 years, he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="1">CHAKOTHI, Pakistan _ Sixty-year-old Khalid Hussain hugged the brother-in-law he had only seen before in photos after traveling from Indian- to Pakistani-controlled Kashmir on the bus service revived between the divided region after a half-century of conflict.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="2">&quot;We are so happy we can't express how we feel,&quot; Hussain said Thursday after crossing a narrow bridge over a rushing river that spans the military Line of Control that cleaves the disputed Himalayan region.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="3">Minutes later he embraced his wife's brother, Asif Solaria, who lives on the Pakistan side and came to meet him.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="4">Fifty-seven years of conflict has divided thousands of Kashmiri families.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="4">Some migrated in the aftermath of the bloody partition of the subcontinent in 1947, many more fled to the Pakistani side when a separatist insurgency took hold in the Indian portion of Kashmir in 1989.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="5">Previously, the only way to reunite was through the long and difficult process of applying for a visa to the other country _ or, during lulls in the violence, by yelling greetings across the roar of the water at the riverine frontier when authorities permitted it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="6">All that changed Thursday, when two buses, carrying about 50 people in all, many of them elderly, shuttled in each direction between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, the capitals of the Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, for 15-day stays.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="7">It was an event treated with pomp on both sides and observed with glee by thousands of Kashmiri villagers scattered on the steep mountainsides of the Jehlum Valley despite storm clouds, rain and lightning.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="7">Many more lined the road on both sides of the frontier.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="8">The bus service _ heralded by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a &quot;a caravan of peace&quot; _ will only run once every two weeks, but it's the most concrete sign that a yearlong peace process aimed at burying the historic enmity between the nuclear-armed rival nations is bearing fruit for Kashmiris.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="9">Until a year-and-a-half ago, the two armies would routinely shell each other, often killing civilians who were displaced from their homes in their thousands by the conflict.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="9">On Thursday, white flags fluttered at either side of the &quot;peace bridge,&quot; its approaches recently cleared of land mines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="10">The peace process has also led to resumption of trains, buses and flights between India and Pakistan, but the launching of the bus link across Kashmir _ severed in 1948 _ is more resonant, holding out some hope of an end to the intractable conflict over the region, which is claimed by both countries in its entirety.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="11">India has long accused Pakistan of fomenting a separatist insurgency in Kashmir that has left more than 66,000 people dead over the past 15 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="11">Pakistan says it gives political backing to the rebels but denies giving military support.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="12">The bus service was launched despite an attack Wednesday in Srinagar by suspected militants on a government tourism complex where passengers were staying.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="12">They traveled anyway the following day, apparently undeterred and making a small piece of history.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="13">&quot;It's taken a long time.</sentence>
