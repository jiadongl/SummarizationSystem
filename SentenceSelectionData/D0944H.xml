The US Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments on the legality of the death penalty for criminals aged under 18 in a case that has received international attention.
The court intervened in the Simmons case only after the Missouri Supreme Court threw out Simmons' sentence last year on the grounds that the 1989 precedent had, indeed, been superseded by the 2002 case.
The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday over whether the time has come to end the death penalty for young murderers.
