		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">Sandra Day O'Connor, the first  woman ever appointed to the US Supreme Court, said Friday that she is retiring, giving US president George W. Bush his first  opportunity to appoint a justice.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">&quot;This is to inform you of my decision to retire from my  position as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the  United States, effective upon the nomination and confirmation of  my successor,&quot; she said in a letter to Bush.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">O'Connor, 75, did not explain why she was resigning.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="3">A Supreme  Court spokeswoman said O'Connor needs to spend time with her  husband who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">Her resignation, which will result in the first opening on the  US Supreme Court in 11 years, will allow Bush to make his first  appointment to the nine-member court which makes many vital  decisions concerning US society.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="4">Experts said the appointment is  set to trigger fierce political battle between the Republicans and Democrats.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">In a statement confirming O'Connor's resignation, Bush said he  will pick her successor in a timely manner so her vacancy can be  filled by the time the court resumes work in October.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="6">He also promised to &quot;be deliberate and thorough&quot; in making the  choice and will consult with the Senate which will confirm his  nominee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman  appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote, has  announced her retirement, a court source said Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">Her retirement, which sets up a long-awaited political battle  for a successor and gives President George W. Bush his first chance  to select a justice for the high court, was confirmed by a Supreme  Court official who requested anonymity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">As rival groups geared up for what is likely to be a bitter  nomination battle, Bush scheduled a news conference for 11:15 am  (1515 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, his spokesman Scott  McClellan said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">O'Connor, 75, who is considered a moderate conservative, was  appointed to the court by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat  in September 1981.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">Her retirement gives Bush the chance to shape the ideological  balance of the court, a fact that could spark a prolonged  confirmation battle in the US Senate for a successor, touching on  lightning bolt questions such as abortion and the separation of  church and state.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">President George W. Bush on Friday  said he would nominate a new Supreme Court Justice in a timely  manner, and called for a dignified confirmation battle, as rival  political camps geared up for battle.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">Bush made a statement in the White House Rose Garden, shortly  after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">&quot;Under the Constitution, I am responsible for nominating a  sucessor for Justice O'Connor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="3">I take this responsibility seriously.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="3">I will be deliberate and thorough in this process,&quot; Bush said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">&quot;The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court Justice  that Americans can be proud of,&quot; Bush said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">&quot;The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in  the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair  hearing and a fair vote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">&quot;I will chose a nominee in a timely manner so the hearing and  the vote can be compelted before the new Supreme Court term  begins.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">Bush also paid tribute to O'Connor, the first woman to serve on  the top US court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">&quot;America is proud of Justice O'Connor's distinguished service  and I am proud to know her,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">&quot;She has been a discerning and conscientious judge and a public  servant of complete integrity.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman  appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote,  announced her retirement Friday, setting up a fierce political  showdown for her seat.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">The move handed President George W. Bush his first chance to  reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense  influence over the lives of Americans, interprets the constitution  and acts as a court of last resort.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">Minutes after O'Connor's announcement, political leaders and  lobby groups fired the first shots in a long brewing battle for the  court's political soul.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">Liberals warned Bush not to name an &quot;extremist&quot; while  Republicans urged him to pick someone who would apply rather than  interpret the constitution -- in other words a strict conservative.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">&quot;The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court justice  that Americans can be proud of,&quot; Bush said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">&quot;The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in  the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair  hearing and a fair vote,&quot; Bush said in a statement delivered in the  White House Rose Garden.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">Bush said he would pick a new justice in a &quot;timely manner&quot; but  the White House said there would be no announcement before he  returns from next week's G8 summit in Scotland.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">The president was set to pore over profiles of potential Supreme  Court picks during the long flight to Europe, his spokesman Scott  McClellan said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">Justices are not term limited, so presidents have a chance to  mould the country for years after they leave the political scene,  through their court choices.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">Bush's chance to remake the court is all the more important  because key cases on abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights are  looming when justices return from their summer break in October.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">Democratic activists fear that Bush will replace O'Connor, who  cast the key votes in two key abortion rights test cases in 2000,  with a 'pro-life' justice.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">O'Connor, a snowy haired 75-year-old judge and former prosecutor  told Bush her retirement would become effective upon the  confirmation of a successor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">&quot;It has been a great privilege indeed to have served as a member  of the Court for 24 terms,&quot; she wrote in a letter to Bush.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">&quot;I will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the  Court and its role under our constitutional structure,&quot; wrote  O'Connor, who was born in Texas and practiced law in the  southwestern state of Arizona.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">Bush and O'Connor spoke in what aides said was an &quot;emotional&quot;  phone call.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="15">With a nod to their shared Texas heritage, Bush said:  &quot;for an old ranching girl, you turned out pretty good,&quot; according to  McClellan.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her  seat in September 1981.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">She often sided with more radical conservatives on the court, as  when she voted with the majority to stop recounts in Florida after  the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over  Al Gore.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">Cancer-stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had been seen as  the most likely justice to retire, but has so far made no  announcement on his future.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="19">O'Connor's retirement opens the first vacancy on the Supreme  Court in 11 years.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="19">The last justice appointed was the liberal  Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and  he took his seat in August 1994.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="20">It leaves Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the  nine justice Supreme Court bench.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="21">Senator Edward Kennedy, who famously scuppered the confirmation  of Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, called on Bush  to appoint someone who could be embraced by all Americans.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="22">&quot;Justice O'Connor was a mainstream conservative who was  confirmed unanimously by the Senate,&quot; Kennedy said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="23">&quot;President Bush is faced with a decision that affects each and  every American.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="24">Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: &quot;America  needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to  equal justice under the law.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="25">The liberal political action committee MoveOn.org swiftly rolled  out a television advertising campaign.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="26">&quot;The message: Don't nominate an extremist who will undermine the  rights of individuals and families as the President did in the Terri  Schiavo case several months ago,&quot; MoveOn.org said in a statement,  referring to the recent Florida right-to-die controversy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">US Republicans and Democrats geared  up Saturday for a major political battle over a successor to Supreme  Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has announced her  retirement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">Her decision, announced Friday, handed President George W. Bush  his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court,  which has immense influence over the lives of Americans, interprets  the constitution and acts as a court of last resort.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">No official announcement has been made.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="9">But the most frequently  mentioned names include Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as well as  federal appeals court judges Michael Luttig, Harvie Wilkinson, John  Roberts and former solicitor general Theodore Olson.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">Justices are not term limited, so presidents have a chance to  mould the country for years after they leave the political scene,  through their court choices.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="24">Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: &quot;America  needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to  equal justice under the law.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">WASHINGTON - President Dwight D. Eisenhower figured Earl Warren would make an ideal chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">Warren, the Republican governor of California, had been a loyal supporter of Eisenhower in the 1952 election.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="2">Eisenhower said he chose Warren the next year because of his deliberate style and his &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; philosophy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">Warren turned out to be one of the most liberal justices in history, leading the court to landmark rulings on civil rights and the separation of church and state.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="3">Eisenhower later said appointing Warren was &quot;the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">As President Bush searches for someone to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her resignation Friday, the experiences with Warren and many other members of the Supreme Court provide reminders that justices often don't vote the way presidents expect.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">Justice Byron White, an appointee of President John Kennedy in 1962, was expected to be a liberal, but often voted conservatively on personal liberty and law-and-order cases.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">O'Connor, named to the court in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, was more conservative in her early years but gradually sided more often with the court's liberals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">Justice David Souter, an appointee of the first President Bush in 1990, has angered conservative Republicans by often voting with the court's liberals.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">&quot;We thought Justice Souter would vote differently than he turned out to vote,&quot; said Boyden Gray, White House counsel under former President Bush.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">He said many presidents have been unhappy with their appointees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">&quot;The landscape is littered with crushed expectations,&quot; Gray said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="9">&quot;You can never predict or control (how they'll vote).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="9">That's just absolutely a fact a life.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">Not enough homework</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">Some justices defy expectations because the presidents who chose them didn't do enough homework.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">That was the case with Souter, a state judge in New Hampshire who served briefly as a federal appeals judge before his nomination to the Supreme Court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="12">Researchers who looked into his record found so little that the press dubbed him &quot;the stealth justice.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">White House aides &quot;really didn't know much about him,&quot; said Eddie Lazarus, a former clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun and author of Closed Chambers, an inside look at the court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="13">&quot;That was their own fault.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">It was difficult to assess Souter because he had been a federal judge for less than a year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="15">&quot;Nobody knew what he stood for,&quot; said Paul Finkelman, a law professor at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="16">The experience has prompted a refrain by many conservatives: &quot;No more Souters.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="17">For other vacancies on the court, presidents have nominated former politicians like Warren and White who have little or no judicial experience.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="17">The presidents assumed the nominees would follow their party's ideology, but it turned out the nominees had different ideas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="18">Mary Cheh, a law professor at George Washington University, said White was a New Deal Democrat who was in favor of &quot;big government and federal programs.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="18">But he surprised many people by often voting conservatively on the court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="19">&quot;He was consistent that he thought the court should stay out of the way of the legislature,&quot; Cheh said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="20">Transformations</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="21">Other justices have changed after they got on the court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="22">In her first few years as a justice, O'Connor was known as the &quot;Arizona Twin&quot; because she voted so often with Chief Justice William Rehnquist, one of the court's most conservative members.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="23">Cheh says O'Connor's opinions in the early days were &quot;very mechanical&quot; and the only issue she was passionate about was states' rights.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="24">But the longer she was on the court, &quot;she became more sensitive to individual rights,&quot; Cheh said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="25">There was a similar transformation for Blackmun, an appointee of President Nixon in 1970.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="26">Blackmun was a longtime Republican, so Nixon and his aides figured he would be a dependable conservative on the court.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="26">In his early years, he frequently voted with conservative Chief Justice Warren Burger.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="27">But Blackmun increasingly sided with liberals and authored the 1973 opinion that is the flashpoint for many conservatives: the Roe vs. Wade decision on abortion rights.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="28">Why the transformations?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="29">Finkelman, the University of Tulsa professor, said getting a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court leaves people free to make their own judgments without being bound by a rigid ideology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="30">&quot;Their vantage point is altered,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="30">&quot;Having gotten to the pinnacle, the top of the highest mountain, they suddenly discover there is no place to strive for.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="30">They look at the world differently.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="31">U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, said it's more common for Republican appointees to morph into liberals than for Democratic nominees to become conservative.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="31">He blames it on the culture of Washington.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="32">&quot;When you surround yourself by other rich lawyers and liberal policymakers, you tend to grow out of touch with Joe Six Pack and Brenda Babysitter out there in the real world,&quot; Feeney said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="33">Lazarus, the former Blackmun clerk, said he agrees there is a seduction, but said it affects nominees who don't come to the job with a strict ideology.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="34">&quot;Once they get on the court, people who are not ideological get swept up in the majesty of interpreting the Constitution's beautiful but vague promises of due process and equal protection,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="34">&quot;That tends to draw them to the left.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="35">Ideologues don't morph</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="36">The court's most consistent conservatives are Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="37">They are the darlings of the right and the foes of the left because they rarely stray from conservative orthodoxy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="38">Legal analysts say they haven't morphed because they are strict ideologues who apply their principles to every decision.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="38">Many conservative groups are urging President Bush to nominate someone like Thomas and Scalia to be O'Connor's successor.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="39">Liberal groups such as People for the American Way are saying just the opposite, urging Bush to pick a moderate.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="40">But how can either side know what they're getting?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="40">How can they be sure they won't get another Warren - or another White?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="41">Both sides are scouring the records of possible nominees to look for clues about how they might vote: judicial opinions, speeches and law review articles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="42">Ralph Neas, president of People for the America Way, said Bush's nominee &quot;is probably going to be either a judge or an academic with a lengthy record that is faithful to the record of a Thomas or a Scalia.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="43">Gray, the former White House counsel, said Republicans have learned lessons from the nomination of Souter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="44">&quot;The most important indicator is their track record - what have they said, what have they written.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="44">I think if you have a candidate who has a known record, that is the best,&quot; Gray said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="45">Cheh, the George Washington University law professor, said Bush and his aides have learned from history and will thoroughly research possible nominees to make sure they get an ideologue.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="46">&quot;The Republicans,&quot; she said, &quot;have made this a high art.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="1">The perennial battle over abortion  rights in the United States is galvanizing conservative and liberal  activists, who are hoping to influence President George W. Bush's  choice to fill a newly-vacated US Supreme Court seat.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="2">For decades, a deep ideological rift over a woman's right to end  an unwanted pregnancy has cleaved this country into two powerful,  and equally-impassioned camps.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="3">Conservatives, who turned out in record numbers to cast votes  last November for the Republican president, see in the retirement of  moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor a historic chance to reshape  the nine-member high court, and fulfill a fervent wish to overturn  the watershed Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case which guaranteed women  the right to an abortion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="4">Liberals, meanwhile, have sternly warned Bush not to name an  &quot;extremist&quot; to the court and have vowed to put up a fierce fight to  safeguard the right to legal abortion.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="5">With a Supreme Court seat now open for the first time in more  than a decade, groups on both sides of the bitter abortion divide  have said they are planning to spend millions to lobby Congress and  the White House, and to rally their supporters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="6">Political observers predicted Armaggedon once the fight to  replace O'Connor is joined in earnest, with dozens of political  groups expected to play a role.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="7">&quot;I think we're in for a pretty partisan battle,&quot; said Orrin  Hatch, a conservative US senator and longserving member of the  powerful Senate Judiciary committee that will vet US President  George W. Bush's eventual Supreme Court nominee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="8">The debate also is expect to further polarize an already-divided  US Senate which will be called upon to confirm the president's  pick.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="9">&quot;He said he's going to pick a strong conservative, and I think  that's going to cause a battle no matter what,&quot; Hatch told ABC  television Tuesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="10">Even before O'Connor announced her departure, the conservative  Progress for America group last month launched a 700,000-dollar  fundraising effort, hoping to beat back &quot;liberal attack groups ...  hungry to smear almost any potential candidate for the Supreme Court  who doesn't meet their left-wing, extemist litmus test.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="11">Likewise, the Family Research Council said on its website that  it is &quot;primed for the fight it will take to confirm a nominee,&quot; and  vowed to mobilize 20,000 churches across the nation to lobby for a  conservative justice.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="12">Liberal groups were equally motivated: The pro-choice Feminist  Majority sounded the alarm within hours of O'Connor announcing her  retirement.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="2" para="13">The worst has happened with the resignation of  Sandra Day OConnor,&quot; the group said on its website.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="17">And the left-leaning &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine this month warned its  readers that &quot;rolling back reproductive rights is only the first act  in a nightmare scenario that could come to pass if right-wing judges  take over the federal courts and the nations highest court.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="7" line="1" para="18">Bush said in a newspaper interview published Tuesday that he  expected to have a new justice on the bench by October, and already  had identified &quot;a good-sized&quot; number of prospects.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="8" line="1" para="3">Republicans and Democrats are geared up for a major political  fight over a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,  who announced her retirement last Friday.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="9" line="1" para="14">On the Net:</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="1">Just when we thought there was no new speculation about President Bush's pending replacement of Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court, along comes a surprise.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="2">During the president's politically correct consultation with the bipartisan Senate leadership this week, several senators urged that someone be considered who is not already on a lower federal bench, the customary source of previous appointments.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="2">A non-judge!</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="2">What a concept.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="3">The president apparently welcomed the suggestion, although the names being circulated so far in public all wear black robes or did so in the past.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="3">&quot;Would I be willing to consider people who had never been a judge?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="3">The answer is: You bet,&quot; Bush told reporters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="4" para="3">He indicated he was already doing so.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="5" para="3">&quot;We're considering all kinds of people -- judges, non-judges.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="4">The idea is that a little hands-on political experience, such as O'Connor had in the Arizona state legislature before becoming a state court judge, might help the nominee reach sensible judicial judgments the country can support.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="5">Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that career lawyers spend too much time with &quot;footnotes and semicolons&quot; and have &quot;very little contact with people.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="5">Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., added that he approved of going &quot;outside the judicial monastery.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="6">This is not as shocking an idea as it seems at first blush.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="6">Chief Justice William Rehnquist, for example, was tapped by President Richard Nixon while an assistant attorney general.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="7">Legal historians point out that of the 108 justices who have served on the Supreme Court, only 48 were actually drawn from the ranks of sitting judges.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="7">The others have been practicing lawyers, attorneys general, Cabinet officers, senators, members of the House, governors, solicitors general and law professors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="8">Indeed, the Constitution does not even require high court justices to have a law degree.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="8">It merely says that judges, &quot;both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="9">The court under Chief Justice Earl Warren is an example of judicial diversity that has stood the test of time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="9">That court handed down the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education ruling outlawing school segregation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="10">Although the Brown decision temporarily caused widespread social turmoil and President Dwight D. Eisenhower later complained that his decision to nominate Warren was his biggest mistake, the unanimous ruling was gradually accepted as the law of the land.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="10">Warren was a former governor and unsuccessful vice presidential candidate and the court included three former U.S. senators.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="10">Their background meant &quot;you had a broader experience,&quot; Specter observed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="11">Rehnquist's bout with thyroid cancer and sudden, short hospital stay this week for a fever have created a spike in speculation that Bush may have two vacancies to fill before the new court term begins in October.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="11">That would give him an opportunity to name simultaneously both a judge and a non-judge, broadening the public appeal of his choices.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="12">This adds a new dimension to the partisan argument about whether any new justice should reveal his or her ideological leanings or be judged only on that vague category, &quot;character.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="13">A non-judge would have a different sort of record than a legal scholar, reflecting political choices made in real life with real consequences, instead of writings full of abstract philosophical theory.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="14">So whose name might join the gossip circus now?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="14">Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has openly lusted for a court seat.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="14">Although an ultraconservative, he is fair-minded and could be easily confirmed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="4" para="14">Alas, he is 71 years old, a tad ancient for a lifetime seat the president sees as an important part of his historical legacy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="15">There are other sitting senators as well who are not extremists and could serve honorably with dignity.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="16">Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., a moderate and a leader of the bi-partisan &quot;gang of 14&quot; that derailed a GOP Senate move to kill the right to filibuster judicial nominations, might be an acceptable bipartisan compromise.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="16">That would also open up a Democratic seat in a red state that Republicans might recapture.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="17">First Lady Laura Bush is publicly plumping for a woman to replace O'Connor, but gender is not foremost in the minds of most legal interest groups.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="17">Bush says he will consider picking a female, but he seems more interested in naming a Hispanic male -- perhaps Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="17">Bush is also getting advice from an unusual quarter, the current Supreme Court justices.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="4" para="17">Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that at a recent luncheon, some of the justices said they would prefer &quot;somebody new on the court&quot; rather than more appellate judges who &quot;sit in their offices and read briefs.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="18">Despite the importance of the work, it can obviously get boring within those marble judicial halls.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="18">Not much dancing in the aisles.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="3" para="18">But a lot of people would figuratively kill to get there anyway.</sentence>
