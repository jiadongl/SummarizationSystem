The Nantucket Sound wind farm, proposed by Cape Wind Associates, would be the country's first offshore wind farm.
Wind turbines have been hailed as an environmentally friendly way to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels.
Advocates of wind power cite Denmark as an example, saying the country generates 20 percent or more of its energy from wind, and Davies of Greenpeace says the record there suggests that offshore wind farms can become tourism destinations.
