Charles Carl Roberts IV may have planned to molest the girls at the Amish schoolbut police have no evidence that he actually did. 
Miller said police could not confirm Roberts IV's claim about molesting young relatives when Roberts would have been a just a child or adolescent himself' family members knew nothing of molestation in his past.
Charles Carl Roberts IV revealed to his family in notes he left behind and in a cell phone call from inside the West Nickel Mines Amish School that he was tormented by memories of molesting two young relatives 20 years ago.
