Nearly one-third of sexually active  Portuguese girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have taken the  "morning-after" pill to prevent pregnancy, according to a study  published Thursday in the daily Publico.
The morning-after pill is a higher dose of the contraceptive hormones found in the Pill.
The U.S. government is considering whether to make morning-after birth control available without a prescription, and like most issues that involve sex and pregnancy, it has generated heated debate.
