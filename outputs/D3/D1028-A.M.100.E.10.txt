WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Jury selection for the trial of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is under way in Sacramento, California, with an unprecedented number of nearly 600 prospective jurors to be interviewed.
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
