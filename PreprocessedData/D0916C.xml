		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Carroll was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, by  kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter, the paper said in a  statement, calling for her release.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">The incident had previously been reported from Baghdad, but  Carroll had not been identified.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">The Christian Science Monitor  newspaper on Monday pleaded for the release of American reporter  Jill Carroll, seized in Baghdad by abductors who gunned down her  Iraqi translator.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">Carroll, 28, a freelancer filing for the  Boston,Massachusetts-based paper, was abducted in western Baghdad on  Saturday, apparently on the way to interview a prominent Sunni  politician.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">&quot;We are urgently seeking information about Ms. Carroll and are  pursuing every avenue to secure her release,&quot; said Monitor editor  Richard Bergenheim.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">&quot;The Monitor joins Jill's colleagues -- Iraqi and foreign -- in  the Baghdad press in calling for her immediate and safe release,&quot;  the paper said in a statement which named Carroll for the first  time.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">The incident was reported from Baghdad by AFP on Saturday, but  the agency, in common with other foreign and US news outlets, did  not identify Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were  launched to find her.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">Carroll had reported from the Middle East for Jordanian, Italian  and other news organizations for the last three years, the paper  said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">&quot;In recent months, the Monitor has tapped into her  professionalism, energy, and fair reporting on the Iraqi scene,&quot; the  Monitor statement said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">&quot;It was her drive to gather direct and accurate views from  political leaders that took her into western Baghdad's Adil  neighborhood on Saturday morning.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">The paper quoted unidentified relatives of Carroll as pleading  for her release and asking her captors to &quot;consider the work she has  done to reveal the truth about the Iraq war.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="10">In a dispatch for the American Journalism Review published last  year, Carroll wrote that she moved to Jordan ahead of the US  invasion of Iraq in 2003 to get a feel for the story.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="11">&quot;All I ever wanted to be was a foreign correspondent,&quot; she  wrote.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="12">&quot;So when I was laid off from my reporting assistant job at the  Wall Street Journal in August 2002, it seemed the right time to try  to make it happen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="12">&quot;There was bound to be plenty of  parachute journalism once the war started, and I didn't want to be a  part of that.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="13">Officials in Baghdad and the Monitor said Carroll was seized as  she was on her way to interview prominent Sunni Arab politician  Adnan al-Dulaimi.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="14">The body of her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was later found  in the same neighborhood.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="15">An Iraqi defence ministry official said Enwiyah was able to tell  soldiers that Carroll had been kidnapped before he died.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="16">Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's  website on Monday, said gunmen jumped in front of her car screaming  &quot;Stop!</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="16">Stop!</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="16">Stop!&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="16">and others jumped in and surrounded Carroll and  Enwiyah.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="17">&quot;They didn't give me any time to even put the car in neutral,&quot;  the driver, who requested anonymity, said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="18">&quot;It was very obvious this was by design.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="18">The whole operation  took no more than a quarter of a minute.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="3" para="18">It was very highly  organized.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="4" para="18">It was a setup, a perfect ambush.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="19">A guard outside Dulaimi's office told AFP on Saturday he heard  gunshots fired a short distance away and rushed to find the body of  a slain man.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="20">Dulaimi however told AFP he had no appointment to meet a Western  journalist.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="21">Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by  insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two  Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="22">Carroll is the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq  since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group  Reporters without Borders (Reporters sans Frontieres, or RSF).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="23">Five of the kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of  Italy  -- were killed by their abductors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="23">The others were released.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="24">RSF renewed its call for Carroll's release on Monday, and  bemoaned the dangers faced by reporters in Baghdad.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="25">&quot;Journalists working in Iraq have once again been caught in a  deadly ambush,&quot; the group said in a statement.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="26">&quot;The interpreters death confirms that the Iraqi press continues  to be the chief victim of the infernal climate for the media in this  country.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">Iraqi and US investigators were  hunting Tuesday for a US journalist kidnapped in Baghdad as a French  hostage who escaped after five weeks of captivity in Iraq arrived  back in France.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Jill Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian  Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by  the office of a prominent Sunni politician, the US newspaper  confirmed on Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body  abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">The incident was reported by AFP on Saturday, but the agency, in  common with other foreign and US news outlets, did not identify  Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were launched to  find her.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="5">&quot;We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are  pursuing every avenue to secure her release,&quot; said Monitor editor  Richard Bergenheim.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="6">Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's  website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it,  and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="7">Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by  insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two  Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="8">Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq  since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group  Reporters without Borders.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="9">Five of the kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of  Italy -- were killed by their abductors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="9">The others were released.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="10">Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52-year-old engineer, managed to  evade his captors on Saturday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="11">He landed at late Monday at a military base in France where he  was met by his daugher and niece, along with Foreign Minister  Philippe Douste-Blazy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="12">Blanche, who escaped from a farmhouse west of the capital, said  he was &quot;delighted to return to civilisation and to French soil.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="13">The hostage developments followed a twin suicide bombing against  the Iraqi interior ministry that killed at least 28 policemen.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="14">The Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the  attack in an Internet message, saying it was to avenge the &quot;torture&quot;  of Sunni Muslims in interior ministry facilities.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="15">Abuse scandals came to the fore in November and December when US  and Iraqi forces discovered two overcrowded interior ministry  detention centres.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="15">Some inmates had reportedly been tortured.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="16">Meanwhile in Washington, the White House Monday denied that the  US government has been negotiating with insurgents and Saddam  Hussein loyalists in Iraq, but acknowledged that it was reaching out  to those who until now have rejected the political process.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="17">&quot;Part of our strategy, a critical element of our strategy, is to  broaden participation in the political process,&quot; White House  spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="17">&quot;We have been reaching out  to the rejectionists.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="18">The spokesman was reacting to a New York Times report Saturday  that said the United States has stepped up contact with some Iraqi  insurgent groups in a bid to exploit tensions between home-grown  rebels and foreign militant groups such as Al-Qaeda.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="19">Washington wants to encourage the Sunni Arab minority to join in  a government of national unity in a bid to undermine Sunni support  for insurgents and allow for the start of withdrawal of US-led  coalition forces.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="20">In addition to the human cost of the war, with 2,209 US  servicemen killed and over 16,000 wounded, the Iraq war will likely  cost the United States anywhere between one and two trillion  dollars, according to a new study co-authored by a Nobel Prize  winning economist.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="21">The research made public Monday by Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia  University, a 2001 Nobel Prize laureate and former chief economist  at the World Bank, and economy professor Linda Bilmes of Harvard  University, argued that current official assessments of the war cost  fail to consider key expenses likely to dog the US budget for years  to come.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">Sunni Arab Muslims protested  Tuesday a raid by US forces on a Baghdad mosque reportedly linked to  the kidnapping of a US reporter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">About 700 people rallied in the gardens of the Umm al-Qura  mosque in the west of the capital to denounce the raid carried out  Saturday night by US and Iraqi forces.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">&quot;This raid was conducted as a direct result of a tip by an Iraqi  civilian that activities related to the kidnapping were being  carried out inside the mosque,&quot; said Lieutenant-Colonel Barry  Johnson, speaking of the abduction Saturday of Christian Science  Monitor reporter Jill Carroll.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body  abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">&quot;Both Iraqi and coalition Forces raided the mosque in the early  morning hours in order to minimize the impact on worshippers and the  surrounding neighborhood,&quot; the military spokesman said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">Six people were detained for questioning, he added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">The Sunni Committee of Muslim Scholars, which is based at the  mosque, confirmed that one of its members, Yunis Aikali, and five  mosque guards were arrested in the raid.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">In a statement, the committee also accused US soldiers of  desecrating the mosque and carrying away files containing the names  of members.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">&quot;The attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque is an attack on Muslims  and Islam,&quot; said banners held up by protesters at Tuesday's rally  which followed morning prayers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">&quot;We call on the occupiers to withdraw from Iraq because they are  the reason for every crime and the death of every innocent in Iraq,&quot;  Harith al-Aubaidi, a member of the scholars' committee, said in his  sermon at the prayer meeting.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="11">&quot;There can be no stability as long as Iraq is occupied,&quot; he  added.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="12">The UN special representative in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, also  deplored the raid.</sentence>
