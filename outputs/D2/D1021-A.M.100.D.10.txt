Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student.
a woman's voice said.
The tapes, broadcast over local television, recorded LaFave, 24, arranging an encounter with the youth, while expressing concern that he not lie to his mother, Tampa prosecutors said.
"Like, I just don't, I mean, I don't want you lying to your mom."
"Are you sure?"
