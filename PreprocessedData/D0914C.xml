		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Israeli officials said they believed the blasts were caused by terrorist bombs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">In the largest explosion, early reports suggested that a truck bomb may have been driven into the Taba Hilton, a large concrete resort hotel in a little village just across the Israeli border and near the Israeli resort town of Eilat.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="11">Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt, yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings and documents were still in the burning hotel.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="11">Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis at other hotels trapped.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="4" para="11">Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying at another Taba hotel, told Israeli television: &quot;Most of the people here haven't come with their cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis that are not operating now.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="12">Television footage at the border showed an Arab Israeli woman being carried by her husband.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="12">As he put her down, she collapsed, and medics rushed to her.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="12">Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulances arriving at Eilat hospitals and unloading the injured, many of them bandaged and bloody.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="1" line="5" para="13">We immediately drove over to the site and found wounded people on the ground.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="6" para="13">There were Israelis among them, they were bleeding in the sand and there was no one there to help them.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="14">The warning about possible attacks came in an unusual public alert from Avi Dichter, the head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, not to go to Sinai resorts during the harvest festival season of Sukkot, when Israel shuts down.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="14">He said there was vague but solid intelligence about a possible attack against Israeli tourists in Egypt's Sinai, where as many as 12,000 Israelis were traveling for the holidays, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="14">The holiday this year began last week and ends Friday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="15">Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the Gaza Strip that borders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians like Hamas and Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="15">Hamas has vowed retaliation against Israel and Israelis for the assassination of two of its leaders this year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="16">But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitude would have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tied to the Gaza operation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="16">Hamas, which has improving relations with Cairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot, a commentator on Arab affairs.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="18">Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, finding it increasingly difficult to attack Israelis in Israel itself, are choosing to attack them abroad.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="18">The militants may also be trying to cause further strains between Israel and Egypt, which are trying to cooperate on the Israeli government plan for a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="19">Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its security responsibilities seriously enough.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="20">The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by making serious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than by accelerating the cycle of violence.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="20">But Egypt will not want the Israeli-Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and is expected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track down those responsible.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="21">The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry, on which it depends heavily.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="21">In 1997, after radicals attacked tourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked down hard on Islamic Jihad.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="22">The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion was caused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescue workers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="25">Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built by the Israelis.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="25">Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimed that Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="3" para="25">International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, along with the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="27">When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: &quot;I heard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything could ever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.</sentence>
