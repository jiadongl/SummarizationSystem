Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800   students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at  Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate  Columbine's overflow.
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School   students are to return to class has been delayed because so many  have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20  massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
