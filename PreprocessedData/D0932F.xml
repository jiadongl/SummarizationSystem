		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="1">The Rwandan government has launched a national war against plastic bags as an attempt to maintain the environment and clean up the country, President Paul Kagame told reporters Monday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="2">Kagame who participated in the clean-up of the Kigali city said that his government had endorsed the ban on all plastic bags and anyone who still owns them ought to face penalties.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="3">&quot;We want people to use traditional baskets and give the land a breathing space,&quot; Kagame said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="4">&quot;We have a real problem with plastic and we are linking this with our efforts to protect our rivers and lakes,&quot; Mugorewera Drocella, minister of lands and environment told reporters.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="1" para="5">However, shop owners feel the government's decision was to hostile and too heavy for them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="1" line="2" para="5">&quot;We have now resorted to using newspapers as packing bags until the government shows us what to be used,&quot; one businessman in the capital city Kigali said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="1">City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents each for grocery bags to discourage use of plastic sacks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="2">More than 90 percent of consumers choose plastic bags, which are blamed for everything from clogging recycling machines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="2">But the fee would also apply to paper bags to help reduce overall waste.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="3">Promoting a healthy environment &quot;means we need to help change people's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns,&quot; said incoming city Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, who takes office in January.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="3">&quot;This is a sensible user fee.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="4">The city's Commission on the Environment will consider the proposal Tuesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="4">Mayor Gavin Newsom is reviewing the idea.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="5">The city's Department of the Environment estimates San Francisco customers bring home about 50 million bags each year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="5">That accounts for about 2 percent of waste, at an annual cleanup cost of about $8.4 million (euro6.45 million).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="6">Grocers and the plastics industry oppose the measure.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="7">&quot;We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach,&quot; said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="2" para="7">&quot;This tax is going to hurt those who can least afford it.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="8">State legislators defeated a bill last year that would have charged 2 cents on each non-recyclable disposable bag.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="2" line="1" para="9">The San Francisco proposal parallels efforts in Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan, which ban plastic bags or charge a fee to use them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="1">In San Francisco, the free grocery bag soon might go the way of the full-service gas station.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="2">City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents apiece for the bags, 90 percent of which are plastic -- and are blamed by environmentalists for everything from clogging recycling machines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="3">Although the environmentalists are not as concerned about the effect of recyclable paper bags on the environment, the proposal would include them, too, with the idea of reducing waste in general.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="4">In turn, the fee would be passed on to the consumer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="4">Proponents of the surcharge hope this will persuade shoppers to give up the convenience of the disposable sack.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="5">&quot;Yes, it's going to be a pain the ass, but that's part of the point,&quot; said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="5">&quot;One thing we've learned is that sending a financial signal to the marketplace tends to modify behavior much better than voluntary approaches.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="6">Trade groups representing grocers and the plastics industry predictably aren't crazy about the idea.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="7">&quot;We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach,&quot; said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="7">&quot;This tax is going to hurt those who can least afford it.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="8">The proposal, set to be considered by the Commission on the Environment on Tuesday, imitates efforts around the world to stem the use of plastic bags -- known in China as &quot;white pollution.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="8">Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan are just a few of the places where the government either bans plastic bags outright or charges a fee to use them.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="9">Trade groups contend that the results of those efforts are mixed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="9">In Ireland, for example, there is anecdotal evidence of increased shoplifting as people bring in their own bags and higher sales of boxes of plastic bags, which consumers use for everything from pet waste to trash cans.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="10">Murray said the local effort is the first in California after an Assembly bill to levy a statewide 2-cents charge on nonrecyclable disposable bags failed last year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="11">&quot;We've attempted to pursue this at a state level, but the lobbyists for the retail industry are too strong,&quot; he said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="12">After being considered by the commission, the proposal would move to the mayor's office or the Board of Supervisors in search of legislative sponsors.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="12">A spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom said the mayor is reviewing it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="12">Meanwhile, the proposal has at least one potential champion on the Board of Supervisors, the newly elected Ross Mirkarimi, who helped found the city's Department of the Environment, which is overseen by the Commission on the Environment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="13">&quot;We all have a responsibility to promote a healthy and sustainable environment, and by doing that, it means we need to help change people's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns,&quot; said Mirkarimi, who will take office in January.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="13">&quot;This is a sensible user fee.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="14">The proposal, which takes the form of a resolution urging the mayor and board to take action, also suggests expanding the surcharge in the future beyond grocers to include drug stores, dry cleaners, newspapers and other retailers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="15">According to the Department of the Environment, consumers lug home about 50 million bags from San Francisco grocery stores each year.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="15">Of those, 90 percent are nonrecyclable plastic.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="16">A report prepared in support of the proposal by Robert Haley, recycling program manager for the environment department, says plastic bags gum up recycling and composting machines at Norcal -- San Francisco's waste management provider -- resulting in $1 million in extra costs and lost revenue from the sale of recyclable materials.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="17">The bags account for 2 percent of the city's total &quot;waste stream,&quot; and picking up and disposing littered bags cost an additional $7.4 million annually, according to the report.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="18">It notes that an estimated 12 million barrels of oil go into the production of plastic bags, while 14 million trees are felled to make their paper counterparts.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="19">Paul Smith, vice president of the California Grocers Association, said the proposal is strongly opposed by the industry group.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="20">&quot;We're not sure where it came from or ... where the 17 cents is going to go.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="20">There's not really a lot of accountability,&quot; Smith said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="21">According to the proposal, grocers would be able to keep half of the fee and would be expected to spend it on city-approved programs, such as discounted reusable shopping bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="22">Shestek, the American Plastics Council spokesman, said some of the costs attributed to plastic bags could be recouped by sending plastic bag waste to companies that can use it as a raw material, such as decking and composite lumber producers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="23">Heidi Melander, president of the Northern California Recycling Association, a supporter of the proposal, said the fee was a tangible way the public can participate in helping reduce waste.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="1" para="24">&quot;We've been trained to want bags,&quot; she said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="2" para="24">&quot;It's gotten out of hand -- everywhere you go, they force them on you, and they think you're weird if you don't take a bag.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="3" para="24">We might not have control over the blister packaging around the electronic equipment we buy.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="3" line="4" para="24">But we have control over taking that bag.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="1">The Ugandan government is considering a total ban on polythene bags after a 50 percent excise duty has failed to reduce their production and usage, reported local press on Tuesday.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="2">Minister of State for Trade Richard Nduhura was quoted as saying that the rampant use of polythene bags has led to environmental disasters like blockage of drainages, suffocation of children and animals and soil degradation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="3">&quot;An excise duty of 50 percent was imposed on plastics in June 2002.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="2" para="3">It has not deterred indiscriminate use of the plastics, prompting us to take drastic measures,&quot; Nduhura said at a meeting on plastics waste management and development of environmentally- degradable plastics in Kampala which was attended by delegates from eight African countries.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="4" line="1" para="4">He added that the government was still looking at optional measures like controlling importation, production, usage and disposal of polythene bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="1">I've gotten more than 70 e-mails responding to my Tuesday column about the San Francisco Commission on the Environment's resolution urging the Board of Supervisors to force supermarkets in the city to charge shoppers 17 cents apiece for bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="2">Roughly one-third of these readers love the idea, saying it will cut down on waste and trash.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="2">Some say the proposal doesn't go far enough, that fees should apply to other stores and bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="3">Roughly one-third hate the idea, saying it's a government plot to raise taxes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="4">The remaining third might warm to the idea, but have some questions and reservations.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="5">Today, I'll share some of these comments, but after this, please, no more feedback on bag fees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="6">-- The European scene: More than a dozen e-mails came from people who live or have lived in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway or South Africa, where charging for shopping bags is common.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="6">Virtually all of them said it's a minor expense or inconvenience, but well worth it.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="7">&quot;My native Germany charges a fee for these bags, and people respond in the best way for the environment -- they bring their own tote bags!</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="7">When I came to the U.S. seven years ago, I was astonished (and disgusted) by the practice of using new bags on each trip.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="7">And while I have to admit that I easily fell into this behavior myself, the proposed legislation reminded me that bringing my own tote bag is an easy way to be a good citizen of our one and only planet Earth,&quot; says Franziska Marks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="8">&quot;I am an Irish citizen living in S.F.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="8">I remember the same excuses being trotted out when this was first introduced in Ireland (in 2002).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="8">The key difference is that the retailers embraced this change as a way to tout their 'green' credentials by offering a free, sturdy shopping tote to each club member for a limited time to carry their groceries (enabling free advertising).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="4" para="8">It really has dramatically reduced the level of plastic bag waste all over the country,&quot; writes Ray Walsh.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="9">-- Pooper scoopers: Many readers told me they put their old bags to good use.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="9">One even sent me a photo of her kitchen recycling center, rigged to hold plastic bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="10">&quot;Everybody I know uses plastic grocery bags for garbage bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="10">They use them to go to the dog park, empty the kitty litter, and a dozen other things.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="10">If you don't get plastic bags with your groceries, then you would have to buy plastic bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="4" para="10">So it sort of defeats the purpose,&quot; writes Jim Knowles of Alameda.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="11">&quot;Considering the estimated 85,000 dogs in San Francisco, has anyone factored the additional citywide expense in cleaning up poo that people will refuse to pick up in a 17-cent bag three times a day?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="11">asks Melinda Graves.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="12">&quot;For about eight years, I have reused bags many times because I want to do my part for our environment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="12">In fact, for one month, I kept count of how many times I reused a single bag.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="12">Seventeen times in one month meant that 17 bags were not sent to the dump!&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="4" para="12">writes Charlotte Pederson.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="13">I feel a book coming on: &quot;101 Uses for Old Bags.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="14">-- Fuzzy math?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="14">My column explained that the San Francisco Department of the Environment came up with the 17 cents by dividing the environmental cost of used grocery bags ($8.5 million annually) by the estimated number of plastic and paper bags distributed in San Francisco supermarkets each year (50 million).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="15">The $8.5 million is the departments' estimate of what it costs the city to sweep up and dispose of bags, plus what it costs Norcal Waste Systems to remove plastic bags from its recycling and composting system.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="16">Some readers point out that city residents already pay for these costs through taxes and garbage-collection fees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="17">&quot;Shouldn't the amount that is presently being paid for garbage service be taken into consideration when determining how much it really costs the city?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="17">Or are residents supposed to pay twice for the same service?&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="17">asks David Schnapf.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="18">Engineer Neil Lillemark says the city's calculation ignores two facts: Some of the 50 million bags distributed each year get reused and don't go immediately into the waste stream, and a fee would cut bag consumption (and thus the city's costs).</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="19">Using certain assumptions, he suggests that &quot;10 cents a bag would be a more fair estimate of the charge which should be applied if they were to go this route.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="20">Some readers suggested it would be more economically efficient to ban free bags, but to allow grocers to sell them for those who forget or choose not to use their own.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="20">That would eliminate the cost of creating a system to collect, track and distribute the fees.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="21">Mark Westlund, spokesman for the environment department, said the 17-cent fee is not set in stone, and if a bag fee went into effect, a reduction in taxes and/or garbage fees &quot;certainly could be on the table.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="21">He adds that the department &quot;would be open to any ideas that would address the issue.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="22">-- Bad bagger behavior: Several readers said grocers could reduce waste if they simply instructed their baggers to use fewer sacks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="23">&quot;Baggers can be careless, often double bagging for no reason, or putting one or two items in a bag that could have fit into another bag.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="23">It's probably faster to use a lot of bags instead of trying to figure out how to make the best use of each bag, but it's so wasteful,&quot; says Sarah Stockton of Daly City.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="24">Paul Smith, a vice president of the California Grocers Association, explains: &quot;We try to minimize breakage to product.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="24">If a bag breaks when a customer is moving it from store to car or car to kitchen, most stores that are members of his association will replace the contents for free.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="25">&quot;There are marketing reasons why we do this,&quot; he says.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="25">However, &quot;There are retailers who are right now evaluating their clerk and bagger training to (encourage) reduction of bags.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="26">-- Good question: Ford Kanzler of El Granada writes: &quot;I've often wondered why food markets don't sell reusable cloth bags at the check stand (along with) all the impulse-purchase junk.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="27">-- Who knows where that bag has been?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="27">Mike McHugh fears reusing bags may be unhealthful.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="28">&quot;A new bag is clean!</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="28">Customers can return home with their items confident that their purchases have been protected from dirt and germs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="28">An old reused bag cannot guarantee such a situation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="4" para="28">It may be dirty, even if you can't see the dirt with your eyes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="5" para="28">It might have held raw meat that may have bled ever so little onto the sides of the bag.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="6" para="28">The bag might even have previously been used to carry poisonous substances!&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="7" para="28">he writes.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="29">Point of interest: When Ireland imposed a 15-cent charge on all plastic shopping bags in 2002, it exempted a number of bags, including those that hold raw meat.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="30">-- Why just supermarkets?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="30">Some readers wonder why the proposal applies only to grocers.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="31">&quot;Saving the environment can be done in many ways,&quot; writes Catherine Ying.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="31">&quot;Instead of making our life more complicated by charging for shopping bags, why don't we start with something that is more of a luxury, such as Diaper Genie,&quot; which wraps dirty disposable diapers in plastic bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="32">&quot;What about stores like Walgreens that try to put every little item in a bag -- even if the customer is a woman with a large handbag,&quot; writes Beth Wells of San Francisco.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="32">And how about restaurants that put food &quot;in those toxic Styrofoam boxes and then put the box in a bag.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="33">&quot;What bugs me is that my Chronicle is delivered every day in a plastic bag.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="33">They are limited in their re-use -- I don't have a dog and don't travel that often, as they make excellent wrappers for shoes or slippers,&quot; writes Doug Stewart.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="34">Chris Blaser, The Chronicle's circulation vice president responds: &quot;Our policy is to only deliver newspapers in plastic bags on rainy/heavy fog days.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="34">Our other general rule is to bag when the forecast is mixed.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="35">&quot;We do, however, have some carriers who bag more frequently (of their own initiative) in an effort to assure that the paper is in good condition.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="35">We do notify any of these carriers to stop bagging (except on rainy days) whenever we receive a call from a customer.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="3" para="35">We also make sure the plastic bags we buy come primarily from recycled materials.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="1" para="36">Westlund says the city might consider extending bag fees &quot;to other areas like fast foods, drug stores, etc.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="5" line="2" para="36">Right now (it's) strictly supermarkets.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="1">LOS ANGELES - Paper or plastic?</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="1">It might not matter soon.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="2">Supermarket shoppers could end up paying for selecting either bag if Los Angeles politicians follow a San Francisco proposal -- and the advice of some environmentalists -- to recoup the cost of cleaning up grocery-sack litter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="3">San Francisco officials are considering a fee of 17 cents per bag in a bid to encourage Bay Area shoppers to bring their own sacks.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="4">Los Angeles city leaders also want to get rid of grocery-bag blight.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="4">Hoping to avoid drastic measures, Councilman Ed Reyes wants manufacturers of plastics and officials in grocery chains to partner with him on bag cleanups and recycling programs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="5">&quot;San Francisco has the wherewithal to charge that much.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="5">San Francisco has a different income group,&quot; Reyes said.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="5">&quot;Here in Los Angeles, I would rather work with the industry before we get into that.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="6">Reyes' proposal to create a task force on plastic bags will likely go to the full City Council next week after being approved Wednesday by the council's Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="6">Reyes hopes the task force will hold its first meeting in March and produce recommendations 60 days later.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="7">So far, plastics-industry representatives have said they will participate in Reyes' task force -- particularly in light of the proposed fee in San Francisco, which they oppose.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="8">&quot;The bag manufacturers in the last few years have gotten together and realize there is an issue,&quot; said Donna Dempsey, executive director of the Film and Bag Federation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="8">&quot;We're willing to work toward that goal.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="9">All sides agree that plastic bags are a blight on the Los Angeles River, where hundreds of white sacks float on the shallow water, stick to rocks and dangle like Spanish moss from tree branches.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="10">City officials were spurred to action by a new mandate to cut trash from the river and from Ballona Creek by 10 percent each year, starting this year, at an estimated cost of $120 million.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="11">Plastics make up more than half of all the trash in the river, and plastic bags alone constitute slightly more than one-third of the litter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="12">Unlike paper or wood or other organic garbage, plastics don't biodegrade.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="12">They cause environmental damage by breaking into smaller pieces that are eaten by fish and wildlife.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="12">Plastic bags also clog the screens installed on storm drains that filter trash from runoff.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="13">&quot;Plastic is the single most important component of the litter.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="13">It's also the most environmentally damaging,&quot; said Kosta Kaporis, an engineer with the Bureau of Sanitation.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="13">&quot;It's aesthetically the worst.&quot;</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="14">Los Angeles River ad hoc committee staffer Lupe Vela is in charge of task force preparation and hopes to bring industry representatives to the table first to see if they can develop voluntary programs.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="15">Right now only about 5 percent of the plastic used in grocery bags is recycled.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="15">Some grocery stores have bins in which to deposit used bags, and some offer a discount -- 5 cents or less -- for shoppers who bring their own bags.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="16">And bags can't be mixed with curbside recyclables.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="2" para="16">They stick to bottles and cans, and they clog sorting equipment.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="3" para="16">Yet there is a demand for the raw material by companies that use old sacks to make more bags or plastic building materials.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="6" line="1" para="17">The task force will likely talk about ways to collect and recycle bags.</sentence>
