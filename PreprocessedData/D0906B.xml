		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="7">The fresh disruption -- coming on top of last year's gridlock at local ports and railways -- persuaded APL to decide to permanently send ``a lot of our transcontinental cargo'' to Seattle rather than Los Angeles, he said.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="8">Decisions like that and Union Pacific's not-infrequent difficulties, in addition to bottlenecks at the ports, ``certainly should cause people to think about the whole infrastructure'' in Southern California, said Jim McKenna, president of the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents West Coast shipping lines.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="9">Husing said the ``real damage is the continuing problems we have, whether it's 93 ships tied up off the coast or Union Pacific not being able to get its cargo through the area.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="10">Union Pacific, which was suffering major congestion problems on its tracks before the heavy rainfall, is the nation's largest railroad, with 33,000 miles of track from the West to the Midwest.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="11">Based in Omaha, Neb., it is one of two railroads that ferry goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach -- the world's busiest port complex -- north and east to the rest of the country.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="11">The other is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="12">About half of the raw materials and finished goods that arrive at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, mostly from Asia, are transported by truck to destinations in Southern California.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="12">The rest is forwarded nationwide by rail, with Union Pacific and Burlington Northern each handling about half of that freight.</sentence>

		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="15">But Union Pacific tracks are higher in elevation than Burlington Northern's are, Union Pacific spokesman John Bromley said, and thus were first to be hit by mudslides.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="2" para="15">The damage was even more pronounced, Bromley said, because ``the slides have occurred in areas where we've had all the forest fires and the ground cover was burned off.''</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="16">Union Pacific's stock fell 38 cents Wednesday to $63.96 on the New York Stock Exchange.</sentence>
		<sentence doc="10" line="1" para="17">Times staff writers Debora Vrana and Evelyn Iritani contributed to this report.</sentence>
